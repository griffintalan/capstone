       "A billionaire who built up a corporate empire from his father’s inheritance now is running his first major political campaign with a promise to shake up the establishment and restore prosperity after a long period of stagnation. But in this case it’s not Donald Trump. It’s Jim Justice, the Democratic candidate for governor in West Virginia and a coal baron to boot. Like Trump, Justice has been accused of not paying his bills and being out mainly for himself. And like Trump, Justice is running a nontraditional campaign that exists well outside the partisan pattern, eschewing Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in favor of a cult of personality based around his exploits in business. As West Virginia’s only billionaire, he can self-fund, pumping $2.2 million into his campaign through mid-June. Justice faces stiff crosswinds, however, running as a down-ballot Democrat in one of Trump’s strongest states. West Virginia polling is scarce and often inaccurate, but a MetroNews West Virginia poll released earlier this month showed Trump with a 49–31 advantage over Hillary Clinton, who won only 36 percent to Bernie Sanders’ 51 percent in the state’s May 10 primary. In an era of declining split-ticket voting, Justice must outperform Clinton by double digits to win. That’s led to a dynamic in which West Virginia’s GOP candidate for governor, state Senate President Bill Cole, is embracing Trump while Justice is distancing himself from Clinton. It’s very nearly the opposite of what’s happening in other states with close races. “Across the nation, Democrats are trying to nationalize their races because they think they can use Trump as a weapon. In this race, it’s pretty clear Democrats are trying to localize, because Trump is not a drag but an asset for Cole,” says Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Larry Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics. “This is one of the few places in the country where Republicans are more concerned with nationalizing a race than Democrats are.” The reason is simple: coal. Republicans have dominated Appalachia the past three cycles by bludgeoning Democrats with “war on coal” rhetoric blaming Obama for the industry's decline. It’s hard to make that charge stick against a coal baron. And Justice definitely qualifies: He inherited an array of coal interests from his father, then enlarged them to become one of the biggest private coal mine owners in the East. That growth included the 2009 sale of his Bluestone Coal Corp. to Russia’s OAO Mechel for $568 million. Then the coal slump hit, and last year Justice bought Bluestone back for $5 million, less than 1 percent of his selling price. Cole, the Republican candidate, has more elective experience than Justice, but he’s no establishment insider. Owner of Bill Cole Automall and other businesses, Cole is finishing only his first term in the West Virginia Senate, having previously served a few months in the House of Delegates when he was appointed to fill a vacant seat. However, Cole spent much of 2016 wrapped up in a state budget crisis and has focused his general election campaign on tried-and-true conservative policy proposals such as cutting spending and taxes, banning late-term abortions and opening charter schools. In a year in which voters largely have embraced personality over policy, that may not be enough, even in a Republican-tilting state with a wildly popular candidate at the top of the ticket. “If you think about the primary races here, we saw a giant Trump win and a giant Sanders win,” says Scott Crichlow, associate professor of political science at West Virginia University. “If you look at Trump, look at Sanders, look at Justice, they certainly have policies that are known—the wall, universal health care, the coal industry—but so much of what’s driving the appeal for them is personality and image, not just a list of policy prescriptions.” Justice is running as a conservative Democrat, not unlike former governor and current U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin, with whom he shares a number of campaign staff. He’s flip-flopped between the two major parties, giving money to both and changing his registration, most recently in February 2015, when he became a Democrat. However, he says he won’t vote for Clinton and dismissed Cole’s claim that he supports Obama as “complete dog snot.” And while Justice spokesman Grant Herring says his candidate “isn’t focused on the national political circus,” the language he uses to describe his appeal sounds awfully familiar. “Jim is no politician,” says Herring. “He is the outsider in this race who has the skills and experience to transform the state.” At the moment, it looks like that approach is working: A MetroNews West Virginia poll released September 3 showed Justice running away with the race at 46 percent, Cole with 32 percent, Mountain Party candidate Charlotte Pritt with 8 percent, and Libertarian David Moran with 5 percent. Many doubt the veracity of the MetroNews poll, which has varied wildly when measured against election results in recent years, but most, including Cole spokesman Kent Gates, agree that Justice is winning. “Do I think Justice has a lead? Yes,” says Gates. “Do I think it’s double digits? No.” Some of that is because Justice’s industry ties largely make him resistant to the GOP’s otherwise effective “war on coal” messaging, which has proven to be Democrat kryptonite around Appalachia, even in districts beyond the coalfields. “If you’re going to win in West Virginia, you better be running against Hillary Clinton,” says Dave “Mudcat” Saunders, a western Virginia political consultant known for his so-called Bubba Strategy, designed to help Democrats appeal to white working-class voters. Saunders, who has said he’s voting for Trump, says voters don’t trust Clinton or care about her support for funding going to help coalfield economies transition to something else. “She said she’s going to put coal out of business. West Virginia coal miners don’t want a handout. They want their dignity. They want their jobs.” But Saunders doesn’t have kind words for Justice either: “He’s screwed every coal operator in West Virginia at one time or another.” Cole sees that reputation as his big opening. His spokesman, Gates, says the Republican campaign will open up attacks on Justice’s business record over the next several weeks. “Jim Justice is a coal operator, but he’s not a coal operator acting in the best interest of West Virginia,” Gates says. “His legacy of unpaid bills is documented across the land.” That record extends from unpaid federal fines to unpaid vendors to unpaid state and local taxes in multiple states. In a 2014 series on delinquent mines, NPR reported that Justice “stands out” among mining operators, owing nearly $2 million in unpaid fines at the time. That same year, a federal agency issued 39 cessation orders against three Justice companies for reclamation violations at Tennessee mines, including hiring a contractor who planted trees upside down. The problems have persisted. This year in Kentucky, Justice’s mines missed reclamation deadlines and owed nearly $2 million in delinquent property taxes. That’s an improvement from last year, when he owed $3.5 million in unpaid Kentucky taxes. In southwest Virginia, Tazewell County officials seized machinery, tools and other equipment from a Justice-owned mine this spring to make up for $850,000 in unpaid property taxes. When 2015 West Virginia property taxes became delinquent in April, Justice owed more than $3.9 million. The pattern apparently extends to Justice’s other businesses, as well: Two companies sued the Greenbrier for unpaid work on its golf courses for the PGA tournament, eventually settling out of court. Justice’s mining record, which includes extensive use of mountaintop removal mining, as well as his issues with mine reclamation, has made him the target of many an Appalachian environmental activist. The Cole campaign going negative on Justice might not push those green voters to vote Republican, but it might tip them toward Pritt, who is running for governor as the candidate of the Mountain Party, the West Virginia affiliate of the Green Party. Pritt served eight years in the state Legislature and is making her third run for governor. The last time she ran, in 1996, she defeated Manchin in a primary on the way to a loss in the general election. Both Cole and Justice have promised to bring back coal jobs, but whoever wins in November faces the monumental task of a state economy that’s suffered mightily with the collapse of the coal industry. According to the U.S. Census, West Virginia’s 2014 median household income was $41,576, compared with $53,657 nationally. Its poverty rate was 18.3 percent, versus 14.8 nationally. Mining jobs have plummeted, falling 19 percent in the past calendar year, 26 percent from a decade ago, and 39 percent from 2011, when the market for metallurgical, or steel-making, coal spiked on the strength of a then-strong Asian economy. Mines sit idle as a string of industry giants— Alpha Natural Resources, Arch Coal, Patriot Coal, Peabody Energy and Walter Energy—filed for bankruptcy due to a convergence of factors including a slumping Asian economy, competition from cheap natural gas, and federal clean-air regulations that resulted in a wave of older power plants closing or converting to natural gas. While the market for metallurgical, or steel-making coal may eventually return, it’s unlikely the same will be true for steam, or power-producing, coal. The coal industry’s struggles haven’t just hurt West Virginia’s employment rate, but also its state budget. The reduction in coal and natural gas severance tax collection contributed to its budget crisis, along with an economy that generally has failed to transition from its fossil fuel roots. In this gubernatorial campaign, neither candidate seems eager to push that process forward. Justice, however, has experience operating in economic sectors such as farming and tourism that may be part of the recipe for recovery. He previously owned Wintergreen Resort in Virginia before selling it last year, and in 2009 he bought the famed Greenbrier Resort out of bankruptcy. Since then, he’s brought an annual PGA tournament and the New Orleans Saints’ training camp to the Greenbrier. In late June, a month and a half after Justice won the Democratic nomination and two weeks before the Greenbrier Classic PGA tournament was scheduled to start, tragedy inadvertently threw a spotlight on the Greenbrier and the communities around it when West Virginia was slammed by historic rains and flooding that qualified as a 1,000-year event in parts of the state. Twenty-three people were killed, including 15 in Greenbrier County, and hundreds of homes were destroyed. Justice canceled the PGA event and closed the Greenbrier Resort, though it opened its doors, free of charge, to house about 200 people who had been displaced from their homes. He shut down his campaign for roughly 10 days following the flooding, appearing only at a brief press conference to announce the Greenbrier’s reopening date. Should he win in November, however, his response to the flooding and actions at the Greenbrier will be remembered as a defining moment. Whether Justice will win, however, remains an open question, double-digit poll lead notwithstanding. Sabato’s Crystal Ball recently moved the West Virginia governor’s race from “Leans Republican” to “Toss-up.” “We’re being cautious because of the fact that Justice will need to run so far ahead of Clinton,” Kondik says. Trump will easily win West Virginia, but the winner of the governor’s race will be determined by how willing voters are to split their tickets, and whether Democrats remain loyal to their party or break for Pritt. That’s why Cole’s campaign is attacking Justice on his record as a coal businessman, even as they decry the federal “war on coal.” Whether those voters go to Cole or to Pritt ultimately doesn’t matter, so long as they’re not voting for Justice. In his attacks on Justice, Cole spokesman Gates repeated one line a couple of times: “At the end of the day, Jim Justice is going to do what’s best for Jim Justice.” That line has been used about Donald Trump, too. The question for West Virginia voters on Election Day will be whether what’s in Justice and Trump’s best interests is in theirs, too.\\n\\n    25.736842\n",
       "As police today captured the man wanted for questioning in connection to a series of explosive devices in New York City and New Jersey, new information about him has begun to emerge.\\n\\nThe man, Ahmad Khan Rahami, 28, was born in 1988 in Afghanistan and is a naturalized U.S. citizen, according to the FBI. He was discovered and captured in Linden, New Jersey, not far from his last known address in Elizabeth.\\n\\nA U.S. official initially told ABC News Rahami came to the U.S. in 2000, but his father later said the family came over in 1995. Court records indicate Ahmad Rahami was from a large family and may have as many as seven siblings.\\n\\nFormer classmates said he attended Edison High School in New Jersey.\\n\\nOne of them, Chris Konya, said Rahami was quiet but funny and a \"pretty normal guy.\" Konya and another former classmate said Rahami had a child with his high school girlfriend.\\n\\nRahami was enrolled at Middlesex County College from fall of 2010 to fall of 2012, where he worked toward an associate's degree in criminal justice but did not graduate, according to school officials.\\n\\nThe Rahami family owned a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth. An employee and a recent customer said Rahami worked there.\\n\\n\"I come in here every week or two, just to get something to eat,\" local resident Ryan McCann told The Associated Press. \"He's always in there. He's a very friendly guy. That's what's so scary. It's hard when it's home.\"\\n\\nMembers of the Rahami family apparently did not get along well with the local police and sued several officers in 2011 for allegedly harassing them over purported violations related the restaurant's operation. The case was dismissed in 2012, pending the resolution of a related legal matter, according to documents.\\n\\nInvestigators are poring over Rahami's past travel, including what may have been a recent nearly year-long trip in which he flew to Quetta, Pakistan in April 2013 and returned to the U.S. through the United Arab Emirates in March 2014, according to the U.S. official. Rahami reported to authorities that he was visiting his wife and family, who he said were Afghan refugees living in Quetta, and that he had traveled by car between Pakistan and Afghanistan.\\n\\nIn August 2014 Rahami was arrested after allegedly stabbing someone in the leg, according to court documents. A complaint filed by a police officer said the officer \"has reason to believe that the person is a danger to himself, others or property,\" but Rahami was not indicted.\\n\\nToday Rahami was shot at least once by police during an exchange of gunfire before he was captured and then taken to a local hospital, authorities said. He is not cooperating with investigators, even so far as refusing to give his name, according to a source briefed on the case. Officials said they have not determined a motive for the attacks.\\n\\nLate Monday officials announced charges against Rahami related to the shootout with police: five counts of attempted murder, second-degree unlawful possession of a weapon and second-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. Bail has been set at $5.2 million. It is unclear if Rahami has an attorney.\\n\\nA senior Afghan official told ABC News the Afghan government is ready to assist the U.S. in any way it can and is searching for any information it may have on Rahami.\\n\\n

       "At least 858 people who had previously been ordered to be deported or removed from the U.S. were instead granted citizenship, the Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general announced Monday. The mistaken citizenships were granted, the Department of Homeland Security explained in a press release, because neither its digital fingerprint repository nor the FBI’s fingerprint repository contain exhaustive records of individuals who have previously been deported. The discovery was made by the Department of Homeland Security’s office of inspector general, which released a report Monday on the incomplete fingerprint records and the mistakenly granted citizenships. The Department of Homeland Security’s records are incomplete, the release said, because paper fingerprint cards used before 2008 were not consistently digitized. The FBI’s records are incomplete because fingerprints collected during immigration enforcement activities were not always shared with the bureau. The inspector general's report specified that those granted citizenship were only \"potentially\" ineligible and were not necessarily granted citizenship incorrectly. A statement from the Department of Homeland Security said that the department is taking steps to correct the issues that led to the incomplete fingerprint records and that not all applicants whose records were incomplete wound up being granted citizenship. \"It is important to note that the fact that fingerprint records in these cases may have been incomplete at the time of the naturalization interview does not necessarily mean that the applicant was in fact granted naturalization, or that the applicant obtained naturalization fraudulently. Preliminary results from the file reviews show that in a significant number of these cases naturalization had been denied and that, in some, naturalization was not improperly granted,\" department spokesman Neema Hakim said in the statement. \"Other cases are subject to ongoing criminal investigation or to denaturalization proceedings that are pending or completed.\" In at least three cases, the inspector general’s office discovered previously-deported individuals who were granted citizenship and then obtained clearance for “security-sensitive work at commercial airports or maritime facilities and vessels.” The release said all three have since had their security credentials revoked. “This situation created opportunities for individuals to gain the rights and privileges of U.S. citizenship through fraud,” Inspector General John Roth said. “To prevent fraud and ensure thorough review of naturalization applications, [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services] needs access to these fingerprint records.” Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has made the vetting of immigrants as they enter the U.S. a major part of his presidential platform, suggesting during the GOP primary that America temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the U.S. until a more stringent vetting process could be put in place. He has since backed away from that proposal, which drew widespread criticism from both parties, in favor of a ban on immigration from “any nation that has been compromised by terrorism.”

       "Donald Trump Jr. said Thursday he was surprised by the reaction to his tweet comparing Syrian refugees to Skittles because he was \"trying to point out things that have to be said.\"\\n\\n\"People will today make what they want of anything and they see the worst in everything and they look for subtext that doesn't exist,\" Trump told reporters after a fundraiser here. \"For me, I guess I'm a straightforward guy. I don't deal in microagression, where it takes a special kind of person to find whatever message they're looking for.\"\\nThe tweet -- which consisted of a photo of a bowl full of the candy that said: \"If I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful? That's our Syrian refugee problem.\" -- took center stage on the campaign trail earlier this week. A top aide to Hillary Clinton called it \"disgusting\" and Clinton supporters attacking the comparison as crass and inhumane.\\n\\nBut Trump supporters -- and the Trump campaign itself -- have repeatedly defended Trump and the tweet.\\nMars, which produces Skittles, rejected the comparison in a statement, saying, \"Skittles are candy. Refugees are people. We don't feel it's an appropriate analogy.\"\\nTrump said he didn't \"want to be a distraction\" to the campaign, but that the negative response was being driven by partisan attacks.\\n\"I understand that running as conservative, there is a different standard,\" he said.\\n\"If a metaphor offends someone then maybe that's the world in which we live today, but I'm not comparing someone to candy,\" Trump said. \"It's a statistical thing. We have to be careful about who we let into this country.\"\\nBut the statistics don't actually back up the contention made in the tweet. According to a recent Cato Institute report, the odds \"that an American would be killed in a terrorist attack committed by a refugee was 1 in 3.64 billion a year.\"\\nStill, Trump said Thursday that it was his broader point was what mattered and that it was part of a discussion that needed to be had and one that tracked closely with the key components of his father's campaign strategy.\\n\"He's created some good dialogue that needed to be had that wasn't being had because PC culture sort of forced real issues off of the table,\" Trump said of his father's campaign. \"The way he's been able to approach that and do that has forced people to actually have a dialogue and that's what this country is about, having that dialogue.\"\\nThat dialogue -- about race, about refugees and about immigrants -- has been harshly criticized by Clinton and Trump detractors as racist, but Trump countered that it has been the driving force behind Trump's success.\\n\"We're not a country where everything has to be in a safe space,\" Trump said. \"That's not what built this country, that's not what made this country great and that's why my father is resonating so well with working class, hard-working Americans. He's giving them a voice again.\"

       "Donald Trump on Thursday pinned the blame for the turmoil in Charlotte, North Carolina, on President Barack Obama, suggesting that the violent protests there show a “wounded country” that “looks bad to the world.”\\n\\nPausing for roughly 10 minutes during an energy speech in Pittsburgh to address the Charlotte unrest, Trump also presented himself as the man to heal America’s racial divide.\\n\\n“Before going any further today, I want to address the turmoil unfolding right now in our country, and it seems to be a never-ending problem,” Trump said. “America desperately needs unity, and it needs the spirit of togetherness that has not really only got us through our toughest times, and we’ve had some tough times, but which has lifted us up in the past to our greatest achievements as a nation.”\\n\\nHe called for a swift end to violence against citizens and law enforcement, insisting that such actions hurt law-abiding African-American families most, and proposed a national anti-crime agenda to address what he characterized as a “national crisis.”\\n\\nHe also vowed to make American cities safer by appointing “the best prosecutors, investigators and federal law enforcement officers” and sympathized with police officers, who carry an “immense responsibility” but must be trained properly, respect the public and be held accountable for any wrongdoing. And he took a shot at Obama’s leadership, or lack thereof.\\n\\n“We all have to walk a mile in someone else’s shoes, see things through their eyes and then get to work fixing our very wounded country. I mean, it’s — we have some real problems, and we do have a wounded country,” Trump said. “Many Americans are watching the unrest in Charlotte unfolding right before their eyes on the TV screens. Others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand. Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world’s leader. How can we lead when we can’t even control our own cities?”\\n\\nTrump, who emphasized that it will be the 45th president’s responsibility “to address this crisis and save African-American lives,” has made an attempt to gain support from African-Americans in recent weeks, albeit through a narrative of poorly educated, impoverished black people who live in crime-ridden inner cities and who, after years of Democratic policies he says has failed them, have nothing to lose by supporting his campaign.\\n\\nTrump's overtures to black voters — often made in front of overwhelmingly white audiences — have done little to dent Hillary Clinton's 80-point advantage among African- Americans. And his sometimes ham-fisted appeals have come along with statements that have done himself further damage: Only hours earlier, he recommended a controversial stop-and-frisk policy, a policing tactic that has been found to disproportionately targets minorities, to curb violence in Chicago, Obama's hometown, and made the unsubstantiated claim that “drugs are a very, very big factor” in what's happening in Charlotte.\\n\\nStill, Trump has tried to cast himself as a unifying figure. Earlier Thursday, during a phone interview with “Fox and Friends,” the Republican presidential nominee said there “just seems that there’s a lack of spirit between the white and the black.”\\n\\n“I mean, it’s a terrible thing that we’re witnessing,” he continued. “You’re seeing it. I'm seeing it, and you look at what went on last night in Charlotte — a great place — and you just see it.”\\n\\nProtests over the killing of Keith Lamont Scott, a black man who was fatally shot by police on Tuesday, turned violent on Wednesday night, leading North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory to declare a state of emergency in Charlotte.\\n\\nBy Thursday, Charlotte officials and Scott's family were arguing over whether he had been carrying a gun when he was shot.\\n\\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney told reporters that police believe Scott was armed, though he acknowledged that a video of his encounter does not prove that conclusively. Putney said the video would be shown to Scott's family but did not commit to releasing it to the public.\\n\\nAt a press conference Thursday afternoon, attorneys for Scott’s family refused to commit to calling for the video to be made public or to addressing the media after viewing it. Charles Monnett, one of the family’s lawyers, said the family's decision would depend on whether the video \"can somehow help us reach that truth.\"\\n\\nJustin Bamberg, another of the family’s attorney’s, said he had not seen any evidence that a gun was present at the scene where Scott was shot. Bamberg dismissed photos showing a gun at the scene by remarking that “pictures pop up online all the time. They come from different sources.” He said that as far as he was aware, Scott did not own a gun. Bamberg also confirmed that Scott’s wife was present when he was shot.\\n\\n“At the end of the day, my priority is the greater good of this family first. That has to be understood,” Bamberg said when asked why the family’s legal team would not commit to calling for the video to be made public. “Yes, we want transparency. We don't create the facts. We live with the facts. But you can't take the burden that is placed on law enforcement as sworn officers and public servants and put that on a deceased person for their family who is in mourning.”\\n\\nThe Obama administration, meanwhile, urged calm -- but the president himself had not made a statement as of 5:00 p.m. ET on Thursday.\\n\\nAttorney General Loretta Lynch addressed the “difficulties” her home state faces but warned against any violent reactions. “I know that these are difficult times, and I know that the events of recent days are painfully unclear and they call out for answers,” she said. “But I also know that the answer will not be found in the violence of recent days. Let us seek all peaceful way forward.”\\n\\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest said that the vast majority of people had demonstrated peacefully.\\n\\n“Unfortunately, we've seen situations in which a small number of people take advantage of that peaceful public protest to engage in criminal activity and, in some cases, violence,” he said. “We've often heard from the families of those who were killed urging people with concerns to express those concerns peacefully and to not perpetuate the cycle of violence. Those have often been quite powerful calls and those are calls that the president has strongly supported.”\\n\\nWednesday's violence erupted as residents, outraged over Scott's death and that of an unarmed black man in Tulsa, Oklahoma, last week, looted and vandalized cars and businesses in downtown Charlotte. According to reports, police in riot gear used tear gas to try to calm protesters, several of whom were injured, including one who was shot by another protester, police said.\\n\\n“I see it even going out. There’s such a lack of — there’s a lack of spirit,” Trump said. “There’s a lack of something. Something’s going on that’s bad, and what’s going on between police and others is getting worse.”\\n\\nThe real estate mogul renewed his call for law and order, pitching it as the solution to the unrest in Charlotte and outrage nationwide over police-involved shootings of black men, who in many cases have been unarmed when they were fatally shot.\\n\\n“Well, it’s wow, here we go again,” Trump said. “It’s very sad. When you look at what’s going on, it’s very sad. It’s very divided, our country, and it’s getting worse. I’m not overly surprised to see it, but it’s happening.”\\n\\nTrump argued that a dialogue between police and the communities they serve won’t solve this problem, pointing to the ambush in Dallas this summer, when a black man killed five officers and injured a dozen more.\\n\\n“If you look at Dallas, there was a dialogue. They prided themselves on dialogue,” Trump said. “And they were constantly talking and meeting and having community groups and, you know, that was — that was a pretty rough situation, to put it mildly. A terrible, terrible situation. That sounds good. It sounds right, but there’s something deeper than that.”\\n\\nWhat’s necessary, Trump maintained, is a combination of law and order and leadership that can unify a divided nation, leadership he intimated is lacking from America’s current leader.\\n\\n“Well, it really has to be — you have to have law and order at the time, you have to have, you know, you have to have a certain spirit, a certain unity, and there’s no unity,” Trump said. “You look at the level of hatred, the, you know, the rocks being thrown and everything happening. It’s so sad to see. You know, this is the United States of America. I mean, it’s so sad to see. But there’s just no unity. There has to be a unity message that has to get out, and it starts with leadership.”\\n\\nBut what Trump didn’t say explicitly, his surrogates did. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani appeared in separate Fox News segments in which they both slammed Obama’s lack of leadership.\\n\\n“First of all, it’s a tragedy that eight years after our first African-American president took office, eight years after we’ve had two African-American attorney generals, the gap and the hostility, if anything, is worse, and I think that’s a tragic failure of leadership,” Gingrich said.\\n\\n“But my guess is he was afraid it’d make him a black president in a narrowing sense,” he added. “He could have launched a program to try to rebuild and reopen and re-engineer hope in these communities. And instead, he became the person who talked about, you know, the Cambridge policeman was wrong, and, you know, Ferguson was wrong and why Florida was wrong.”\\n\\nGiuliani said Obama should have lectured Americans on constitutional law Wednesday. Referring to last Friday’s shooting death of Terence Crutcher, who was unarmed with his hands raised when he was fatally shot by a white police officer, the former New York mayor acknowledged that that incident was “a more difficult situation” than what transpired in Charlotte that belongs in the “ambiguous, troubling category.”\\n\\n“But even there, you gotta say to people, ‘Wait, let the investigation play out.’ The president of the United States should have said that yesterday,” Giuliani said. “The president of the United States should have given people a teeny bit of a lecture on constitutional law, that we presume people innocent, and that same presumption exists for police officers as everyone else.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          27.750000\n",
       "Donald Trump’s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway praised her candidate for showing restraint at the tail end of Monday night’s debate when Hillary Clinton attacked his history of disrespectful and derogatory remarks about women.\\n\\n“I have to say, certainly as a woman, I appreciated the restraint at the end. I am not sure I would have been able to exercise it myself, but restraint is a virtue and it’s a presidential virtue,” Conway told MSNBC’s Morning Joe Tuesday. “To tell Hillary Clinton after she accused him of being terrible with women, to tell Hillary Clinton ‘I was prepared to go rough tonight and I am not going to do it because your husband and daughter are here.’ That is going to grow in importance in the next couple of days in a moment of great temperance and restraint.”\\n\\nWith just minutes left in Monday night’s debate, Clinton managed to work in a line of attack against Trump that she has also used most-recently in a new campaign ad, hitting the Manhattan billionaire as “a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs.” After the debate, Trump told CNN that ““I was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, I can't do it,” indicating that he was uncomfortable leveling such an attack with Clinton’s husband and daughter in the audience.\\n\\nTuesday morning, Conway was happy to fill in the blanks for viewers wondering what exactly Trump’s attack might have been.\\n\\n“I think he could have said what was on millions of Americans’ minds, no doubt, that are we going to relitigate who’s been good to women and who hasn't?” Conway said. “They’re taking a couple comments he made over any number of years as a private citizen, versus where he could have gone, and I think we all can finish the sentence. People did last night, they finished the sentence, they said, you know, maybe he was going to talk about Bill Clinton's record with women, but he decided not to.”\\n\\nOverall, Conway said Clinton failed to deliver a “knockout punch” that would have forced Trump into a major error. Instead, Trump’s campaign manager said the former secretary of state came off as rehearsed and determined to squeeze her talking points into the conversation, regardless of how pertinent they were to the questions of moderator Lester Holt.\\n\\n“Donald Trump is guilty of answering the question asked, and I thought Hillary Clinton last night wanted to make sure that no matter what was asked and what was answered, she was going to repeat back to us everything that she had learned in the last week or two weeks, and that’s fine,” Conway said.\\n\\n“I don't think Hillary Clinton did a thing last night. If somebody can correct me, what was the big takeaway moment where she offers this huge vision for economic growth and an end to wage stagnation,” she added. “So I didn't hear any big moment for her where she convinced the 70 percent of Americans who want change, who want a different direction, that she's their gal.”

       "During a Republican primary debate in September 2015, now-Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he never lobbied Florida Governor Jeb Bush for casino gambling because “he would’ve gotten it, if I wanted it.” But if that is true, then Donald Trump committed yet another yet another felonious offense by the racist mogul – this time for for lying under oath in a civil court deposition, which is perjury, as Newsweek reports:\\n\\nOne of these stories is a lie—a detailed, self-serving fabrication. But unlike the mountain of other lies he has told, this time the character trait that leads to Trump’s mendacity is on full display: He makes things up when he doesn’t want to admit he lost. Assume the story he told at the debate is the lie. Even though Bush’s story reinforced what Trump was saying at rallies—he had played the “cash for outcomes” political game for years—he could not admit he had tried to do the same in Florida because he could not bring himself to say that he had lost. Instead, he looked America in the eye and lied. And then he felt compelled to stack on another boast: His people are so wonderful that they would have gotten casino gambling in Florida, regardless of Bush’s opposition—if Trump had wanted it.\\n\\nThe transcripts below will show you there was a dispute of fact between two candidates, but not just any fact, a fact which Jeb Bush would’ve full well known, as would have Trump. Because after Trump’s naïve attempt to muscle gambling into Florida over the objections of an anti-gambling Republican governor failed, he sued his former employee for his own failure. Eichenwald’s point is that either Trump lied baldly to the face of a former elected official on national television (and moderators let him get away with it unchecked) or: Now consider the other option, that Trump committed perjury in the 2007 testimony. There, he admitted pushing for casino gambling in Florida, but said he would have gotten what he wanted if he hadn’t been tricked by Fields. The rationale for the perjurious testimony is simple—Trump wants money from a man who stopped working for him and, once again, the story lets him deny he is anything less than perfect.\\n\\nWhy is all of this important? In the late 1990s, House Republicans impeached Democratic President Bill Clinton for allegedly lying in a deposition about a sensitive personal offense to his wife. The entire media hounded President Clinton over the Whitewater “scandal” for half of the decade and it was the only thing they could find.\\n\\nRepublicans selected a nominee who is legendary for his lies, but unlike Trump’s other tall tales and obvious gaslighting, this lie was either told to a Florida court of law under oath (it does seem like Trump lives in the Florida court system at times) or to national television and his party’s base to discredit his opponent by turning the truth on it’s head.\\n\\nTrump’s penchant for turning the truth upside down is not only a disastrous character flaw, but it’s a mortal danger to our national safety that he is even on the ballot as a major party candidate for President.\\n\\nSee for yourself the two transcripts Newsweek published and decide for yourself if Trump perjured himself to the court or lied to the Republican debate audience. Compare the two options presented by Eichenwald, there’s no third option here: Bush: “The one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on something—that was generous and gave me money—was Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida.”\\n\\nTrump interrupted Bush:\\n\\nTrump: I didn’t—\\n\\nBush: Yes, you did.\\n\\nTrump: Totally false.\\n\\nBush: You wanted it, and you didn’t get it, because I was opposed to—\\n\\nTrump: I would have gotten it.\\n\\nBush: Casino gambling before—\\n\\nTrump: I promise, I would have gotten it.\\n\\nBush: During and after. I’m not going to be bought by anybody.\\n\\nTrump: I promise, if I wanted it, I would have gotten it.\\n\\nBush: No way. Believe me.\\n\\nTrump: I know my people.\\n\\nBush: Not even possible.\\n\\nTrump: I know my people. A lawyer asked Trump, “Did you yourself do anything to obtain any of the details with respect to the Florida gaming environment, what approvals were needed and so forth?”\\n\\nTrump: A little bit.\\n\\nLawyer: What did you do?\\n\\nTrump: I actually spoke with Governor-Elect Bush; I had a big fundraiser for Governor-Elect Bush…and I think it was his most successful fundraiser, the most successful that he had had up until that point, that was in Trump Tower in New York on Fifth Avenue.\\n\\nLawyer: When was that?\\n\\nTrump: Sometime prior to his election.\\n\\nLawyer: You knew that Governor Bush, Jeb Bush at that time, was opposed to expansion of gaming in Florida, didn’t you?\\n\\nTrump: I thought that he could be convinced otherwise.\\n\\nLawyer: But you didn’t change his mind about his anti-gaming stance, did you?\\n\\nTrump: Well, I never really had that much of an opportunity because Fields resigned, telling me you could never get what we wanted done, only to do it for another company.

       "Few places in Germany are as representative of the country’s heartland as Kallstadt, the village in which U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s grandfather was born — and from which he was later deported.\\n\\nThe hamlet of 1,200 people lies nestled among vineyard-covered hills, about an hour-and-a-half’s drive southwest of Frankfurt. It has one bakery and one butcher. Every year, Kallstadt holds the Saumagenkerwe in celebration of the eponymous local delicacy: pig’s stomach filled with pork, herbs, bratwurst and diced potatoes.\\n\\nTrump may have captured a large swath of the American electorate with his signature blend of populism, nativism and brazenness. And yet, in the hometown of his forefather, he remains distinctly unpopular.\\n\\nIn fact, few politicians are less popular in Germany than Trump. A study by the Pew Research Center found out that only 6 percent of the country finds him trustworthy.\\n\\nSince a local newspaper discovered that Johannes Steiniger, a member of the German parliament, was distantly related to Trump, the 29-year-old has done all he can to distance himself from the presidential candidate. “With his statements about gay people and foreigners, or with the language he uses, and with his derogative statements about Hillary Clinton, Trump seems to do everything he can so that we get a negative image of him,” Steiniger tells POLITICO.\\n\\nTrump’s rhetoric regarding immigrants and racial minorities is especially unpopular in Kallstadt. “He stands for everything that’s bad,” says Sarah Bühler, yelling to be heard over the 20-person brass band celebrating the Saumagenkerwe in the town’s main square. Bühler is a former local “wine princess,” the 2009 victor of a beauty pageant to promote the local wine industry.\\n\\nThis year, a new dish appeared in the town’s annual festival: Saumagen-Döner, a fusion of the local specialty with a Turkish kebab. “Everyone is welcome to join us here, no matter what color they are,” says Bühler. “Pink, purple, doesn’t matter.”\\n\\nTanja Huber, the 24-year-old incumbent regional wine princess, nods her head in agreement. Since the prospect of a Trump presidency first became evident late last year, reporters have descended on Kallstadt, seeking a bit of local color, a quote or two, and perhaps some hometown pride. “They don’t get that we really don’t give a damn about Trump,” says Huber. “He’s never been here, and he apparently doesn’t care about us, either.”\\n\\n*   *   *\\n\\nDonald’s grandfather, Friedrich Trump, was born in Kallstadt into a vintner’s family on March 14, 1869. Previous generations of the Trump family used variant spellings of the name, including “Trump,” “Dromb” and “Trumpff,” according to local historians, or even “Drumpf,” according to a 2000 family history by Gwenda Blair; but by the time Friedrich was born they had settled on “Trump.”\\n\\nGermany did not yet exist as a nation; Kallstadt was part of the province of Palatinate in the Bavarian Kingdom. The region was going though rough times. Unemployment was high. Those who had the courage, left.\\n\\nFriedrich’s father died when he was eight years old, and his mother struggled to make ends meet. At 16 years old, Friedrich decided to follow his sister Katharina, who had emigrated to the United States two years earlier. He arrived in New York on board the Eider on October 19, 1885.\\n\\nHe entered the U.S. through official channels, but he had left Bavaria illegally. “Both he and his mother must have known that he would not have been granted official permission to leave the country unless he had paid a bail guaranteeing that he would later return to do his mandatory military service,” said Roland Paul, the recently-retired director of the Institute for Palatinate Regional History and Folklife Studies in the city of Kaiserslautern.\\n\\nAccording to documents uncovered by Paul, Friedrich was stripped of his Bavarian citizenship “as his own request” four years after arriving in the U.S.\\n\\nBut Friedrich was not done with Palatinate. Seven years after his citizenship was withdrawn, he visited the land of his birth to attend the wedding of his sister, according to the 2000 family history by Blair. Five years after that, he returned once more to Kallstadt, where he met 20-year-old Elisabeth Christ; they were engaged, and Friedrich came back a third time to marry her in August 1902.\\n\\nBut while the couple moved back to New York soon after the marriage and had a daughter, Friedrich had promised his wife that he would sell his property in the U.S. and return to the land of their birth. “My grandmother said, I will marry you, but I will not go back to America with you,” Donald Trump’s American-born cousin John Walter told German filmmaker Simone Wendel in 2012.\\n\\nFriedrich seemed intent on keeping his promise. In 1904, he applied for permission to travel to Kallstadt. And although he claimed in his application that he intended “to return to the United States within a year with the purpose of residing and performing the duties of citizenship therein,” he took all his savings from the U.S. with him, according to Blair’s family history.\\n\\nBack in Kallstadt, Friedrich attempted to get his citizenship back. But though he secured the support of local authorities, the district government put a halt to his plans. On February 27, 1905, a deportation notice was sent to the town office of Kallstadt declaring that Friedrich was “to be told he has to leave Bavarian state territory by May 1 of this year, at the latest.”\\n\\nFriedrich was able to obtain a three-month grace period because his daughter had fallen ill. But eventually, he and his wife — pregnant once more — had no choice but to board the ship Pennsylvania on July 1, 1905, and return to New York. Shortly after that, Donald’s father, Fred Trump Junior, was born.\\n\\n“[The authorities] said, ‘You are not a German citizen, you gave up your citizenship, you have to leave,” says Walter. “So they left and they went back to America, and that’s why Donald and I are here.”\\n\\nFriedrich — now named Frederick — died in May 1918 of the Spanish flu. His widow survived her first husband by 48 years and visited Kallstadt many times during her life.\\n\\nIn February 2012, Simone Wendel, the German filmmaker from Kallstadt, was given an audience with Donald Trump. Roughly two years earlier, she had begun work on “Kings of Kallstadt,” a documentary about the two most famous sons of her tiny hometown: Donald Trump and Henry John Heinz, the inventor of Heinz Ketchup.\\n\\nFor months, Wendel had tried to arrange a meeting with Trump, but his office had not replied to her letters. She was only able to secure a visit with the help of Walter, Trump’s cousin, who had visited Kallstadt and seemed happy with the attention she was paying to the family history.\\n\\nOn the day of her visit, Wendel stood nervously next to Walter in a conference room on one of Trump Tower’s top floors. She had brought a Linzer torte and two bottles of wine with screw-on tops.\\n\\nHer plan was to sit down with Walter and Trump for coffee and cake, the traditional afternoon snack in her home region. But when she asked Trump’s staff to make some coffee, the only reaction she got was irritated faces. “His assistant just couldn’t be bothered,” she says.\\n\\n“Hello, John,” Trump said, when he entered the room, shaking his cousin’s hand and looking confused at Wendel in her loose turtle neck and the lonely cake on the huge table in front of her.\\n\\nTrump sat down in front of a one-meter-long model of his Boeing 757-200 airliner and a panoramic window overlooking New York’s Central Park. Wendel, trying to remedy the situation, pushed the cake in his direction and asked him to smell it. “Afterwards, I just kept on thinking, ‘What on earth did I do?’” she says.\\n\\n“The cake looks really good,” Trump said, and he and Wendel ended up talking for almost an hour.\\n\\nUntil 1990, Trump still claimed his family was Swedish, a version of his family history first introduced by his father in reaction to the anti-German sentiment in the U.S. during the two World Wars. But by the time Wendel visited, he had become proud of his German roots. “They grow them well in Kallstadt,” he told her during their meeting. “They grow them very well. Believe me. It’s good stock.”\\n\\n“Wow, it’s beautiful,” Trump said when she handed him a picture of the house where his grandfather was born, an inconspicuous one-story building with a gable roof. “That’s fantastic. See how well-maintained it is? Everything is perfectly maintained. It’s great.”\\n\\nWhen their interview was over, Walter took Wendel on a tour of Trump Tower. On one of the floors, they ran into Trump’s son, Eric Trump.\\n\\n“Have you ever heard the word Kallstadt?” Wendel asked him.\\n\\n“Kallstadt?” Trump Junior replied, “No, what is it?”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  25.900000\n",
       "Former Port Authority executives and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie staffers planned to make the traffic from the September 2013 lane closures at the George Washington Bridge \"as bad as possible,\" according to testimony heard in federal court Monday.\\n\\nDavid Wildstein, former Port Authority director of Interstate Capital Projects, testified that in June 2013, Bridget Kelly, Christie's former deputy chief of staff, was upset that their office had not secured the endorsement of the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee New Jersey, Mark Sokolich, for Christie's reelection campaign.\\nWildstein, who has previously pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy to commit fraud on federally funded property and one civil rights violation, told Kelly that shutting down access lanes to the George Washington Bridge to put some political pressure on Sokolich was an option, according to his testimony.\\nWildstein is testifying as part of his plea deal. Sokolich testified last week that being a \"Democrat in a Democratic town\" put him in an uncomfortable position vis-a-vis a Christie endorsement, and he eventually declined because he did not want to \"alienate anyone.\"\\nOn August 13, 2013, and as CNN has previously reported, Wildstein received an email from Kelly saying: \"Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.\"\\n\"Got it,\" Wildstein responded.\\nA phone call with Kelly the same day established the lane closures would go forward, it was revealed in testimony Monday.\\n\"I did not question senior officials in the office of the governor,\" Wildstein said in court when asked if he questioned the decision.\\nWildstein became the de facto organizer of the eventual lane closures, and communicated every step of the way with Kelly and his then-boss, former Port Authority deputy executive director, Bill Baroni, according to his testimony.\\nWildstein and Kelly discussed and agreed that there would be no advance notice of the closures to Fort Lee officials or the public. They discussed how the Port Authority would respond to any inquiries, and agreed that all calls would be directed to Baroni's office and Baroni would not return the calls, testimony revealed.\\nThis \"radio silence\" policy was discussed with and approved by Baroni, Wildstein said.\\nWildstein testified that that lack of advance notice was to \"maximize the impact on Fort Lee.\" Wildstein also recalled discussing the timing of the closures with Baroni and Kelly.\\nBaroni asked when the first day of school in Fort Lee was, and when Wildstein told Baroni it was September 9, Baroni smiled and said, \"Fantastic,\" according to Wildstein's testimony. Kelly agreed on the September 9 date.\\nWildstein testified that his initial plan was to shut down all three Fort Lee access lanes, but after discussing the matter with Port Authority engineers who feared this could cause \"sideswipe crashes,\" Wildstein recommended to Baroni and Kelly that they shut down two lanes.\\nOn Friday, September 6, 2013, Wildstein informed several Port Authority staffers of the closures that were scheduled to begin on Monday, September 9.\\nBob Durando, Port Authority general manager of the George Washington Bridge expressed concern, telling Wildstein that the closures would cause a \"mess.\"\\nWildstein told Durando the closures would be going forward, and to prepare accordingly.\\n\"I told him not to say anything to anybody,\" Wildstein testified. Wildstein told Durando to direct any inquiries he gets during the closures to Baroni's office.\\nWildstein then informed former Port Authority chief engineer, Peter Zipf, of the closures, and asked Zipf to organize a way to get \"some numbers\" on the traffic patterns.\\nWildstein also informed Cedrick Fulton, Port Authority director of Tunnels, Bridges and Terminals. Fulton asked if Port Authority executive director, Patrick Foye, was aware. Wildstein testified that he told Fulton \"yes,\" but that this was a lie.\\nAll of these staffers were under the impression that the closures were part of a traffic study.\\nOn the day the closures began, Wildstein watched the traffic build up on screens inside a Port Authority administration building on the Fort Lee side of the George Washington Bridge.\\n\"I knew the plan that I had set into motion was working,\" Wildstein testified.\\nA Port Authority lieutenant also drove Wildstein around Fort Lee so Wildstein could see the traffic on the ground.\\nWildstein testified that he called Kelly that morning to tell her that traffic was building up, and \"she was pleased.\"\\nSeveral calls and emails began coming in to Baroni and Wildstein from Fort Lee officials, including the mayor, Sokolich, but their plan of \"radio silence\" was put into effect and no messages were returned.\\nLast week, Wildstein testified that Baroni's role at the bi-state agency was essentially to be a representative of Christie's administration and that their top priority was to represent Christie's office's interests.\\nWildstein said he created a phrase that he and Baroni often used, \"the one constituent rule.\" This referred to the fact that Governor Christie's opinion or good favor was the only one that mattered when it came to Port Authority affairs. Wildstein and Baroni used the \"one constituent rule\" as a barometer by which decisions would be made.\\nKelly and Baroni face conspiracy and fraud charges in connection with Bridgegate. Their attorneys have previously said they will both testify in their own defenses.

       "Freedom is the bedrock that this nation was built upon. The problem is, liberals hate freedom. Oh, sure — they pay lip service to its importance, but ultimately, they want people to be subservient to a liberal-controlled government. They may not want a tyrannical king, but a tyrannical government of socialist-loving politicians pushing government-controlled everything is A-OK with them. They can’t ever say this out loud, though. Which makes the speech Obama just gave to the United Nations rather surprising. Obama actually admitted that he thinks it’s necessary for the United States to give up a little liberty… you know, for “safety”.\\n\\nTuesday, Obama spoke to the United Nations General Assembly. “We can only realize the promise of this institution’s founding to replace the ravages of war with cooperation if powerful nations, like my own, accept constraints,” he said. “Sometimes I am criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions. But I am convinced in the long run, giving up some freedom of action, not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests, but binding ourselves to the international rules over the long-term enhances our security.”\\n\\nSo evidently, Obama believes that we should relinquish more of our freedom and sovereignty so that the international community can rule over us. How this will make the country safer, he didn’t explain. But safety relies on us bringing more Muslim refugees into the United States. “Ultimately our world will be more secure if we are prepared to help those in need and the nations who are carrying the largest burden with respect to accommodating these refugees,” Obama said.\\n\\nObama may want to take a look at how Germany is doing. Accepting tons of refugees without screening them first has certainly not made their country safer — it’s made it more dangerous. And right here in the United States, we have had multiple terrorist attacks over the last year.\\n\\nHow allowing over 110,000 Muslim refugees with no vetting whatsoever into our country will keep us safe is not something that Obama can actually explain, because it’s a completely ludicrous idea. And turning the United States into a country that has to answer to the United Nations before we act on anything doesn’t make us safer, either. It’s a typical liberal idea: something that is nonsensical and useless, yet will weaken the country and strip Americans of their constitutionally-protected rights. But hey, who needs freedom, right? Obama has an agenda to push.

       "Germany’s chancellor Angela Merkel has been the biggest proponent of bringing in as many Syrian refugees as possible, adopting a literal open borders policy to bring in the migrants.\\n\\nThis quickly turned into a horror show, as crime was unleashed onto German cities, with thousands of sexual assaults and other violent crimes were reported over the last year.\\n\\nThe German people had apparently had enough of this rampant crime in Germany, because they just dealt a crushing blow to Merkel’s conservative Democrat party and voted them out by a large margin.\\n\\nMerkel then took to the stage to backtrack as much as she could, citing that the migrant crisis could have been avoided, and that she regrets the mistake she made, also referring to multiculturalism as a “living lie.”\\n\\nSpeaking to the party faithful at its annual conference, she repeated her catchphrase from throughout the migrant crisis, ‘we can do this’, but effectively admitted Germany could only cope if she wrestled back control of the influx.\\n\\n‘A continuation of the current influx would in the long-term overwhelm the state and society, even in a country like Germany,’ she said.\\n\\nThe leader, once known as the ‘Iron Chancellor’, won rapturous applause after announcing the volte face. However, she resisted calls to set a limit on the number of arrivals.\\n\\n‘We want to, and we will, noticeably reduce the number of refugees,’ she told the conference in Karlsruhe. ‘With an approach focused on the German, European and global level, we will succeed in regulating and limiting migration.’\\n\\nHere she is, saying that multiculturalism is a “living lie.” Yes, of course, when you bring in thousands of people who have ideologies that are incompatible with Western values, it’s not great for a free society. But as long as these flip-flopping opportunistic politicians act as if they’re not a part of the problem, then we will never get anywhere.\\n\\n

       "Hall of Fame rock legend Gene Simmons made a name for himself playing the bass guitar and singing for the pop-rock band KISS. In more recent years he’s been a reality TV star, a cultural icon, and an outspoken defender of the free market system and personal liberty. The combination of these things has made Simmons marketing gold among more conservative NASCAR loving, flag waving Americans. The folks at TMZ recently ran into Simmons in the airport security line and asked him for his thoughts on the recent bombings.\\n\\nSimmons told TMZ that he thought the Muslim terrorist bomber, Rahami, “should go to jail and be somebody’s girlfriend.” Ouch. TMZ then asked Simmons how he would solve the problem of Islamic terrorism in America, to which Simmons replied, rather politically incorrectly, that we needed to do more profiling.\\n\\n“Nobody says the word ‘profile.’ Everyone needs to get smart. I’m ok with profiling. I want you to stop me first. I want you to stop me because I look a certain way. And if I’m clear, then profile someone else. It’s emergency powers during war. There’s a war going on.”\\n\\nBut what about the people who were being “unfairly” profiled, TMZ wondered. Simmons held nothing back in his perfect response. “It is unfair. That’s why the words ‘too bad’ exists.”

       "Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump both met with world leaders in town for the United Nations General Assembly on Monday, but the two presidential contenders did so with vastly different goals.\\n\\nBoth Clinton and Trump met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi Monday, as the grueling presidential contest enters its final weeks.\\n\\nClinton, who served for four years as President Barack Obama's secretary of state, also met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.\\nWhile the stakes are high for both candidates, there is likely more on the line for Trump who, as a foreign policy novice, is still looking to prove his chops before the first presidential debate next Monday.\\n\\nTrump used the meetings to try to convince voters that despite his often explosive personality he is qualified to serve as commander in chief. The key for the blunt businessman is the visuals of the meeting, hoping that voters see a president as they observe him with a world leader.\\n\"I will say that with all the folks being in New York, I've had a lot of calls from a lot of different people on the basis that I'm doing well and, you know, they seem to think it's important to maybe meet,\" Trump said Monday on Fox News. \"I don't want to comment specifically on who but a couple of people are coming over.\"\\nHe later said, \"I've already met with a couple,\" but refused to say which ones.\\nClinton used the meetings with the three world leaders, in contrast, to stress her facility with high-level diplomacy gained by years of experience on the world stage. Her meetings are also certain to be watched in various parts of the world for signs of how she would direct US foreign policy as president.\\nClinton addressed prickly topics with each world leader, according to aides in the room. Clinton touched on North Korea and the rise of China with Japan's Abe, while Clinton addressing the need for a more vibrant -- and free -- civil society with Egypt while she met with Sisi.\\nWhile reporters were in the room, Clinton told Sisi that she looked forward to talking about the \"path we are taking in order to build up a new civil society, a new modern country that upholds the rule of law, that respects human rights and liberties.\"\\nTrump also met with Sisi on Monday evening in New York where the two discussed \"the strategic bilateral relationship between the US and Egypt,\" according to a Trump campaign statement after the meeting.\\nSen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama and Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn (ret.), two of Trump's top foreign policy advisers, joined Trump for the meeting.\\n\"Mr. Trump expressed to President el-Sisi his strong support for Egypt's war on terrorism, and how under a Trump administration, the United States of America will be a loyal friend, not simply an ally, that Egypt can count on in the days and years ahead,\" the Trump campaign said.\\nThe Republican nominee, who has faced widespread condemnation in the Muslim world for his proposal to ban Muslims from the U.S. and his blanket statements about Islam, also shared his \"high regard for peace-loving Muslims,\" the campaign added.\\nThe campaign also said Trump called the US-Egypt relationship \"vital to help promote peace and stability in the Middle East.\"\\nSisi is the second foreign leader Trump has met with since becoming the Republican nominee. He first met with the Mexican president in Mexico last month.\\nSitting with Poroshenko, Clinton said she was looking forward to talking about the challenges Ukraine faces, primarily \"the very real problems and threats from Russian aggression.\" Clinton added that she was \"anxious to know how we can be supportive of those efforts.\"\\nClinton's meetings were announced before Trump's, and a senior advisor to the former top diplomat said Friday that they were less about furthering a political argument than preparing her to hit the ground running immediately if she wins the White House.\\n\"If she is elected, she wants to be sure she is prepared (not only) to handle the challenges but to seize the opportunities on Day One,\" said a senior Clinton advisor granted anonymity to talk about her foreign policy views. \"While she has remained a candidate, she is also focused on what it would take to govern if she wins.\"\\nThe meetings also set up possible contrasts that could pose a challenge for Trump given Clinton's lengthy record on the international stage as both secretary of state and first lady.\\nTrump has tried to shore up his foreign policy credentials before, taking a trip last month to meet Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto earlier this year.\\nThe meeting ended awkwardly after Trump said they never talked about his proposed border wall, but Peña Nieto said he told Trump during the meeting that Mexico would not pay for it.\\nClinton's campaign seized on the public back-and-forth between the Mexican leader and Trump, with the Democratic nominee calling it Trump's \"embarrassing international incident.\"\\n\"When you see that he can't even go to a foreign country without getting into a public feud with the president, I think the answer is clear: Donald Trump does not have the temperament to be our commander in chief,\" Clinton told voters in Ohio after the meeting.\\nFor her part, Clinton has decided to forgo the standard foreign tour as a candidate because her aides feel she doesn't need to burnish her foreign policy credentials.\\nInstead, she'll take the opportunity afforded in her home state to hobnob with foreign heavyweights -- and try to score political points.\\nClinton's meeting with Poroshenko, in the eyes of her aides, attempted to highlight the differences between the Democratic and Republican nominee on policy toward Moscow. Clinton's campaign and other Democrats have accused Trump of cozying up to Putin, who has built his foreign policy on thwarting US goals and failing to confront Moscow over its annexation of Crimea in Ukraine.\\nClinton's adviser said that she believed that Washington needed to do more to stand up to Russian \"aggression\" in Ukraine and to allow the Kiev government to defend itself.\\nCurrently, the Obama administration has offered logistical help to Ukraine's armed forces but has fallen short of lethal assistance as some Republicans have championed. The official did not say, however, whether Clinton would move toward lethal aid but said that she would take a look at any requests from the Ukrainians.\\nClinton's meeting with Sisi will make waves in the Middle East because of the recent estrangement between the Egyptian President's government and the Obama administration.\\nClinton, according to an aide in the room, \"emphasized the importance of respect for rule of law and human rights to Egypt's future progress\" and \"discussed ways to deepen counterterrorism cooperation, particularly in the fight against ISIS.\"\\nClinton also used the meeting to call for the release of US citizen Aya Hijazi, who has been imprisoned in Egypt since 2014 after operating a non-profit in the country.\\nClinton's adviser cautioned that the meeting on Monday did not augur any kind of policy change towards Egypt. But nevertheless, the official said, Clinton does understand the complexity and complications of US relations with Egypt, a nation that is pivotal to the balance of power in the Middle East, is facing its own terror threats and would be critical to any renewed effort at Israeli-Palestinian peace.\\nSisi assumed power following a coup against the elected Muslim Brotherhood government in Egypt in 2013. Clinton had been secretary of state when the US helped push Egypt's longtime strongman Hosni Mubarak from power after a popular uprising, but was seen as less pro-active than other members of Obama's cabinet in cutting loose a crucial, long-standing US ally.\\n\"There are a lot of things that the Sisi government is doing that are concerning,\" the official said.\\nTrump's positions on foreign policy, among them on Egypt, are more opaque than those of Clinton. But in his terrorism speech in August, he vowed to work with leaders in the Middle East -- including Sisi -- who \"recognize that this ideology of death\" must be extinguished.\\nClinton's meeting with Abe comes at a time of increased tensions in Asia following North Korea's latest nuclear weapons test. The meeting will likely highlight Clinton's commitment to US alliances in Japan and South Korea and the US belief that it is up to China to do more to convince its ally in Pyongyang to turn away from its nuclear path.\\nClinton, according to an aide, discussed \"the threat from North Korea\" and \"relations with China\" during the meeting. And Abe brought up the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a massive 12-country trade deal that the Japanese prime minister has backed and Clinton has rejected.\\nThere is significant concern among US allies the region about the prospect of a Trump presidency -- not least because the GOP nominee has warned that both nations must pay more to keep US forces in their countries and raised the possibility that Pyongyang's growing threat could force both states to develop their own nuclear weapons, a step neither nation wants to take.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       14.285714\n",

       "Hillary Clinton kicked off a campaign event Wednesday by saying that the recent police killings of two African-American men that unleashed a national uproar this week are \"unbearable\" and \"intolerable.\"\\n\\nClinton used those words the day before to describe last week's shooting death of Terence Crutcher in Oklahoma, but revisited the issue Wednesday in light of the death of Keith Lamont Scott in North Carolina. Her comments -- which came at the beginning of a lengthy speech about improving economic opportunities for disabled Americans -- marked her first on-camera remarks on the shootings, which have again sparked a debate about lethal police force.\\n\"There is still much we don't know yet about what happened in both incidents. But we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of African Americans killed by police officers in these encounters,\" Clinton said. \"It's unbearable. And it needs to become intolerable.\"\\nThe Democratic nominee added: \"I know I don't have all the answers. I don't know anyone who does. This, though, is certain: too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have.\"\\nEven as she referred to the deaths as \"two very upsetting incidents,\" Clinton also urged the public against channeling their anger by targeting police officers as she pointed to the protests that unfolded Tuesday night.\\n\"Every day, police officers across our country are serving with extraordinary courage and honor and skill,\" she said. \"I've spoken to many police chiefs and other law enforcement leaders who are as deeply concerned as I am, and deeply committed, as I am, to reform. Why? Because they know it's essential for the safety of our communities and our officers.\"\\nThe racially charged issue of the deaths of black civilians in confrontations with the police has taken center stage multiple times in the 2016 election, and Wednesday was not the first time that the Clinton has commented on the issue.\\nThis week, Scott -- a father of seven -- was killed by police in a parking lot when police officers were searching for another man to serve a warrant. His family has said that Scott was unarmed and reading a book in his car, but the Charlotte-Mecklenburg police says that Scott came out of the car with a gun.\\nIn Tulsa, Oklahoma, last week, Crutcher was killed in a confrontation with police officers. Crutcher was unarmed, and videos of the incident shows Crutcher standing next to his car and falling to the ground after an officer shot him. The officer's attorney later said she was afraid Crutcher was trying to reach for a weapon.\\nClinton's Republican opponent, Donald Trump, also reacted to Crutcher's death on Wednesday, saying in Ohio that he was \"very troubled\" by the fatal shooting.\\n\"I must tell you, I watched the shooting in particular in Tulsa and that man was hands up, that man went to the car -- hands up -- put his hand on the car. To me, it looked like he did everything you're supposed to do,\" Trump said. \"This young officer, I don't know what she was thinking. I don't know what she was thinking, but I'm very, very troubled by that and we have to be very careful.\"

       "Hillary Clinton's campaign manager said Wednesday that the Democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma.\\n\\n\"There are two prongs to her approach,\" Robby Mook, Hillary for America campaign manager told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on \"New Day.\" \"The first is to have a set of national standards around how to manage the situations that doesn't exist right now and that could help through training to prevent situations like this.\"\\n\\n\"There are no set of national best practices on how to manage situations,\" he continued. \"These situations are handled by local policies currently. And what she is proposing is that we actually set up national standards so that localities have better policies to work with and train towards.\"\\nClinton spoke out Tuesday against \"systematic racism\" following the recent shooting of Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Crutcher was shot and killed last week after his car broke down. The 40-year-old black man raised his hands above his head just before Officer Betty Shelby fatally shot him. Crutcher was unarmed at the time.\\nThe Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said Wednesday that \"approximately 12 officers\" were injured during protests after the fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott Tuesday by a police officer.\\nMook said the other part of Clinton's plans involves working to improve the relationship between police and minorities.\\n\"The second piece is to restore bonds between communities and law enforcement, so investing in community policing and making sure that local police have the resources to build the resources in the community to prevent something like this from happening,\" he said.\\nClinton told radio host Steve Harvey on Tuesday's \"The Steve Harvey Morning Show\" that she plans to speak \"directly to white people\" about implicit bias. Mook said Wednesday Clinton meant she would explain that different ethnic groups are often treated differently in America.\\n\"What she's saying is our entire country needs to do some real soul-searching here. It is clear that the criminal justice system is not treating everybody the same way,\" he said. \"If you are African-American or from a minority group, you may not be being treated the same as a white person. And that's a problem.\"\\n\\nClinton said Tuesday that while there are \"good, honorable, cool-headed police officers\" working across the country, \"we can do better.\"\\n\"We have got to tackle systemic racism,\" Clinton said. \"This horrible shooting again. How many times do we have to see this in our country?\"\\n\"This is just unbearable,\" Clinton said. \"And it needs to be intolerable.\"\\nClinton later tweeted on the shooting, writing, \"Another unarmed Black man was shot in a police incident. This should be intolerable. We have so much work to do. #TerenceCrutcher -H.\"\\n\\nIn response to the Crutcher shooting, both the Department of Justice and state authorities have launched investigations into the officer-involved shooting.\\nDanny C. Williams, US Attorney of the Northern District of Oklahoma, said prosecutors will attempt to determine whether a federal civil rights violation had occurred. Authorities refused to immediately answer additional questions due to the ongoing investigation.

       "House Speaker Paul Ryan ducked Thursday on whether he supports the \"stop and frisk\" policy pushed by Donald Trump.\\n\\n\"I don't have an answer for you because it's not something that I've familiarized myself with -- the constitutionality of it, its efficacy, whether (it) worked well in New York City or not,\" Ryan said after being pressed twice by reporters on the policy the GOP nominee wants to revive, despite court rulings finding it unconstitutional.\\nRyan called for calm following the shooting in Charlotte, saying about the unrest in the city overnight, \"these images are just so heartbreaking and they are upsetting.\"\\n\"The loss of any life is a tragedy. The response to that though cannot be more violence. As leaders, it is responsibility to promote calm, peace and dialogue. We cannot allow our nation to be divided up along racial lines and so I hope leaders can come together to find solutions,\" Ryan said.\\n\\nThe House speaker repeatedly brushed back reporters' efforts to have him weigh in on the law enforcement policy that Trump said he wanted to implement.\\n\"I haven't given enough thought to it,\" Ryan said initially about \"stop and frisk,\" and added, \"we need to do more to stop home grown jihadism.\"\\nHe touted his \"better way\" agenda and then shifted to stressing that law enforcement has used their own strategies, \"I think there are success stories that local law enforcement have used to guard against this and that's the kind of ideas we need to have.\"\\nEarlier this week Ryan said he wanted Congress to complete work on a major criminal justice reform bill. But at his weekly news conference he made it clear he didn't want to comment on the GOP nominee's proposal saying it wasn't an area where he had expertise, referring reporters to Judiciary Committee

       "I woke up this morning to find a variation of this headline splashed all over my news feed:\\n\\nNaturally, my reaction was “oh, s**t, what did Bill Clinton do to damage his wife’s campaign now?”\\n\\nOf course, the headline sounds really, really awful. It plays right into the idea that the Clinton Foundation is all about pay to play, just like Donald Trump has been saying all along. Unfortunately, it takes reading beyond the headlines, which is something most people don’t do, to find out the real story – and the real story is that there is no pay to play.\\n\\nIn other words, people can ask for favors, but that certainly doesn’t mean they’ll get them. Leaked emails have shown that some Clinton Foundation donors have gotten meetings with Clinton and that others were turned down. There is zero evidence of pay to play. In other words, people might have asked for favors, but there’s no evidence they got them.\\n\\nNow, let’s talk about the foundation the media doesn’t like to mention, the Trump Foundation. Trump hasn’t given to his own foundation since 2008. He does collect money from others, though, and gives it in his name. He also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets, all for himself, but out of charity money.\\n\\nNew York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a September 13 CNN interview that his office is investigating Trump’s charitable foundation over concerns that it “engaged in some impropriety” as related to New York charity laws. The investigation launched amid reports from The Washington Post that Trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself, such as a $20,000 oil painting of himself and a $12,000 autographed football helmet, and also recycled others’ contributions “to make them appear to have come from him” although he “hasn’t given to the foundation since 2008.”\\n\\nSource: Media Matters\\n\\nMedia Matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote Trump at the cost of Clinton’s candidacy:\\n\\nJournalists have been criticized for the “double standard” in the ways they cover Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Earlier this month, cable news programs devoted 13 times more coverage to Clinton’s pneumonia diagnosis as The Washington Post’s reporting about the Trump Foundation. This week, both the Trump Foundation and Trump Organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of Donald Trump’s Dr. Oz stunt.\\n\\nAll of this biased coverage is hurting Clinton and helping Trump. Trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks, largely because the media covers every minor Clinton “scandal” (if you call getting sick a “scandal”) while ignoring every scandal in Trump’s closet, and trust me, there are a lot.

       "I would say our President is useless, but really, this goes beyond useless and right into the realm of arrogance.\\n\\nHe has done some pretty brain dead things in the past and has made some incredibly insensitive and idiotic statements but this? This is just tone deaf to the nth power.\\n\\nI’m guessing that if you’re reading this right now, you keep up with the news, or at least have a tendency to follow breaking events. That being the case, you already know about the couple of bombings that happened in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, as well as the stabbing that occurred in St. Cloud, Minnesota.\\n\\nWhile you would think that this would be enough to prompt an immediate statement from our elected officials, you would be wrong.\\n\\nSurely you’d want to hear the man or woman you voted for stand in solidarity with the people against this kind of terrorism, especially on our own soil. Surely the men and women you elected would at least want to do that much, if not because they actually mean it, then for votes in the upcoming election.\\n\\nWell apparently your President doesn’t have any such feelings about the matter. In fact, not only did he not talk about the bombings while he was in New York, he ignored them in favor of speaking at a high-dollar fundraiser.\\n\\nAre you outraged yet?\\n\\nIt gets better. In lieu of addressing the domestic terror that had just occurred, he lamented the “sexism” he says has been pushed by the likes of Rush Limbaugh and Fox News (who has more female faces than any mainstream media outlet I’ve ever seen, including MSNBC), claiming that they are the reason Hillary Clinton’s campaign is going down the tubes.\\n\\nHe bashed Trump while lauding Hillary as some kind of savior, while never mentioning the men and women who were injured in explosions that officials agree were terror-related.\\n\\nCritics will say that he didn’t have enough information to make an informed statement at the time, but you don’t have to know every single detail to say “an explosion has taken place here in New York and I would like to take a moment to recognize the people injured and offer them my thoughts and prayers, and would ask you guys to do the same. I will be making a more in-depth statement later as I receive more details.” And then move on to the business of the hour.\\n\\nBut no, he couldn’t even be bothered to do that. Disgusting.

       "Local school boards shall develop and implement policies that require every school restroom, locker room, or shower room that is designated for use by a specific gender to solely be used by individuals whose anatomical sex matches such gender designation. Such policies may also provide that a student may, upon request, be granted access, to the extent reasonable, to a single stall restroom or shower, a unisex bathroom, or controlled individual use of a restroom, locker room, or shower.\\n\\nAny student who willfully and knowingly violates this section shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $50. Civil penalties assessed under this section shall be paid into the Literary Fund. Any law-enforcement officer may issue a summons regarding a violation of this section. \\n\\nHe did not deign to inform us how this would be accomplished, but it’s hard to imagine any scenario that did not involve adults inspecting the genitals of children before using the bathroom. Notably, it also provides for stigmatizing transgendered children by isolating them in a single person bathroom, which the Department of Justice ruled in June was a violation of the student’s rights. It is a disgusting show of transphobia that has no place in our public schools; the GOP must accept that America is a multi-gendered, multi-ethnic nation, and no amount of perverted laws is going to change that.

       "NEW YORK – All politics is geopolitical in this year's presidential race -- and top Democrats and Republicans fear that will reshape America’s relationships around the world no matter who wins. This week, the uncertain state of those relationships will be on full display in New York as the United Nations General Assembly gathers and the presidential contenders stage meetings meant to project which alliances they favor and which expertise they want to claim. On Monday, Hillary Clinton will meet with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko—a clear dig at the developing partnership between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. She’ll also sit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, her campaign announced Sunday night, rejecting the suggestion that her opponent is better positioned to guide the global economy or to counter the rise of China and North Korea while reminding Americans of Donald Trump’s suggestion that America should pull its support from Japan and South Korea. Clinton and Trump both have scheduled meetings with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi—an American ally, though one with dictatorial tendencies. The Democratic nominee set hers up first, aiming to project to voters that she’s up-to-speed on counter-terrorism and other issues roiling the region. Trump’s came second and was an attempt by Sisi to ensure even dealings, according to Egypt’s state news agency. Nonetheless it might offer the Republican nominee a chance to frame up a position on Middle East issues that goes beyond simply banning Muslim immigrants from America. Keeping presidential politics domestic has long been more stated tradition than reality: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not so subtly telegraphed support for Mitt Romney four years ago and Obama’s summer 2008 foreign tour was built around a 200,000-person rally in Berlin that was projected to voters at home that they should catch up to the forward-looking Europeans and support the upstart young senator. But none of this compares to the degree to which this year’s race is defined by global affairs – the result of the first former secretary of state in 200 years to be nominated for president and the challenges Trump has made throughout his campaign to fundamentals of American foreign policy. Clinton is already planning, if elected, to concentrate on convincing foreign capitals that Trump and the number of votes he gets in November isn’t a sign that they need to be worried about America turning away from them. “She’s very concerned,” said a Clinton aide. “There’s no doubt that when you have a major presidential candidacy saying what he’s said, it has an effect on foreign policy.” Certainly, presidential politics simply no longer stops at the water’s edge, and this year, it has lapped aggressively, perhaps dangerously, over America’s borders. “It will have lasting impact,” said Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), the ranking member on the Foreign Relations Committee “It has been changed,” agreed Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.), a former chairman of the Homeland Security Committee and a Trump supporter. “It gets a little bit risky when you try to bring foreign support into it.” There has been a long list of international never-befores in 2016, including Trump’s decision to accept an invitation from Mexico’s president and then commandeer a joint press conference at the presidential palace to declare America’s sovereign right to build a wall separating the two countries. And that’s hardly all. There was the alleged Russian-led hacking of Democratic campaign committees to dump emails and other information through WikiLeaks, Trump operatives pulling tougher language about the invasion of Crimea from the GOP party platform, Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi saying he’s personally rooting for Clinton, Vice President Joe Biden saying Trump doesn’t “understand” NATO on a trip to Latvia last month, President Barack Obama getting asked by foreign leaders for a year to weigh in on the presidential election. And just Friday, London Mayor Sadiq Khan, speaking in Chicago, accused Trump of “playing into the hands” of ISIL. Officials openly wonder what Clinton’s approach as president would be now to Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, or how quickly and forcefully NATO would restructure if Trump wins. What if China or Russia or North Korea moves to test the new president right after Inauguration Day? What if an international economic or humanitarian crisis erupts? While many in Washington’s diplomatic community say they have a clearer sense of how Clinton, as opposed to Trump, would want to respond, doubts are growing that either would be able to summon the national resolve to do. Her meetings this week are about twisting the knife politically on Trump, the aide acknowledged, but they’re also about thinking through what being on the job on Jan. 20 might entail. Take Poroshenko, who is rebuking Putin just by being in office: “It’s impossible not to read politics into it somewhat, but because of the way Trump’s been talking over the course of the campaign, Secretary Clinton thinks it’s important from a policy standpoint,” the aide said. If Trump wins, he’ll have to quickly confront leaders around the world who would be shocked that U.S. voters had elected him, and afraid that he would ushering in a new and dangerous world order. “They will certainly want to see where we’re coming from,” King said. “He will have to clarify and make it clear where he’s coming from.” If Clinton wins, she’ll have a clean-up that Cardin and others compare to the repair mission Obama first gave her as secretary of state after the global souring on George W. Bush. Cardin, who’s firmly behind Clinton, ran through a litany: sitting in Harare earlier in the year, watching Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe laughing as the conversation turned from his own human rights abuses to Trump’s success, the conversations with leaders in bilateral meetings who quickly ditching the old diplomatic decorum to start griping, drinks afterward with officials who are even blunter. “Can you imagine if Trump were president and we’re trying to get a coalition against ISIL and we need to get the support of moderate Sunni states, and we need to do things that are perhaps against their local popular position? Can you imagine what Donald Trump’s comments about Muslims coming to America would have on a leader of a moderate Muslim state?” Cardin said. “It’s that type of problems that have now been caused.” This has all made for tricky travels for Obama, as he’s spent significant time abroad this year nailing down his foreign policy legacy as president as the campaign has intensified. Being abroad doesn’t stop people from asking for his take on Trump and the race, whether in closed bilateral meetings or at press conferences. Obama tends to draw his own line for where to stop himself, but critics and even occasionally his own aides can feel like he goes too far. “It's not a mystery to people overseas that Democrats and Republicans in the United States have their differences,” said a senior administration official. “So that's why leaders traveling overseas don't make as much of an effort to conceal it.” From the beginning of his presidency, Obama saw himself as embodying a generational shift in the world order, from shifting more of the burden in the Middle East to Arab nations to the kind of interlocking international effort that put sanctions on Putin and brought the Iranians to the nuclear negotiating table, to reopening Cuba. He’ll make that case and the case for going forward in his own speech to the U.N. General Assembly Tuesday morning. But the argument is going to be largely defined by who his successor is. Trump didn’t run his Mexico trip by the White House. Clinton didn’t run her meetings this week by the White House either. “We’re having a serious debate,” said Ivo Daalder, now the president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, and Obama’s first U.S. permanent representative to NATO. “We’re going to live with the consequences and the impact of the debate.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      25.000000\n",
       "New evidence has been uncovered by a private investigator that proves Jim Comey was a dirty cop who had to go.\\n\\nAfter former DNC staffer Seth Rich was murdered his family asked people to stop speculating about his involvements and to respect their privacy.\\n\\nAt the time many of us connected the Wikileaks revelations to his death and concluded he was killed to send a message to other would be leakers by people within the DNC or from within the Clinton campaign.  Of course we were dismissed as conspiracy theorists.\\n\\nNow it has been reported that former D.C. homicide detective Rod Wheeler had been hired by Rich’s family to run a parallel investigation to the one being conducted by the F.B.I.\\n\\nBoth the D.C. police and the F.B.I. had been involved but Wheeler revealed that neither, “The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming.  They haven’t been cooperating at all. \\n\\nWheeler also confirmed that his sources have told him that “absolutely” there is information on Rich’s laptop that links Rich to Wikileaks.\\n\\nWheeler also was told by his source inside the D.C. Police Department, “Rod, we were told to stand down on this case and I can’t share any information with you.” \\n\\nAccording to Wheeler, “That is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department.  Again, I don’t think it comes from the chief’s office, but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor’s office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out.” [Tuesday].\\n\\nIt’s apparent that Wheeler was being guarded in giving his statement but the fact is the F.B.I. has been in possession of Rich’s laptop and the agency’s director at the time, James Comey locked down the contents to protect either certain people at the DNC, or members of Hillary’s campaign team, or Hillary Clinton, or likely all three.\\n\\nComey’s contention that the DNC server contained proof that Russia hackers affected the election is falling apart as we watch the mad scramble that is ensuing following the recent ransomware attacks.\\n\\nIn explained the ransomware attack, experts are shooting holes in Comey’s claim that the F.B.I. is capable of tracking attacks backwards.\\n\\nHector Monsegur, Director of Security Assessments for Rhino Security Labs and a former computer hacker who had been arrested by the FBI informant before turning informant said:\\n\\n“Attribution is probably the hardest thing the FBI is dealing with here.”\\n\\n“It’s nearly impossible because you have various hackers from pretty much anywhere. Also, they are aware of techniques to track them down. So you could have an Egyptian hacker who uses Russian software so it looks like it’s Russian but is actually from Egypt.”\\n\\nComey was definitive that Russia had hacked the DNC’s computers with the intention of helping Donald Trump get elected.  Here’s what we’ve learned since Comey made that declaration to congress:\\n\\nThe F.B.I. never did a forensic examination of the DNC servers.  Instead they took the word of the company the DNC hired to look into it. \\nExperts, ones who worked for the F.B.I., admit that attribution is nearly impossible even if you are in possession of the computers that were hacked. \\nComey “concluded” that Hillary Clinton did not intend to commit espionage despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary but that the Russians intended to help Donald Trump without presenting a single shred of evidence that the Russians were even involved.\\nRevelations such as this continue to surface.  They are the reason that former Federal Prosecutor Joseph DiGenova said of Comey, “he’s a dirty cop.”\\n\\nComey had to go and President Trump did the right thing in firing him.  Contrary to the talking points coming out of the D.C. swamp, Trump gave Comey every opportunity to prove his fealty to the law once he had been freed from the constraints put on him by Obama and Loretta Lynch.  When Comey continued protecting known criminal behavior to save the swamp he left Donald Trump no choice but to fire him.\\n\\nAmerica deserves an F.B.I. director who is determined to prosecute criminal behavior no matter where he finds it.

       "On Wednesday, the Senate is expected to override President Obama's veto, for the first time, on a bill that would allow the families of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia.\\n\\nSo how exactly does a veto override work?\\n\\nThe rules are described in Article 1, Section 7 of the Constitution. When the president rejects a bill, he is required to return it, along with his objections, to the chamber in which the bill originated. Then, the members of that chamber \"shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it.\"\\n\\nIn other words, the president sends vetoed Senate bills back to the Senate to reconsider first and vetoed House bills back to the House to reconsider first. In this case, the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA, began in the Senate, so the Senate votes first.\\n\\nBoth the House and the Senate require a two-thirds majority to successfully override a president's veto. Both chambers also require the \"yeas and nays\" to be counted. In the House, the members vote using the electronic voting system and in the Senate they take a roll call vote, in which each senator’s name is called by the clerk.\\n\\nThough the Senate received President Obama’s veto message on Friday, they’re not voting on it until Wednesday. This is common, according to the Congressional Research Service, because it gives senators time to work out the terms under which they will reconsider the vetoed bill, including the amount of debate time on the Senate floor.\\n\\nThen, when the vetoed bill comes up for a vote, the presiding officer of that chamber states, \"Shall the bill pass, the objections of the President of the United States to the contrary notwithstanding?\"\\n\\nWhile some Senate Democrats and Republicans have concerns that the JASTA bill would open the United States up to similar legal retaliation from other foreign nations and tarnish its relationship with Saudi Arabia, a key Middle East ally, the veto override is expected to easily garner the two-thirds votes needed to pass.\\n\\nAssuming it clears the Senate, the JASTA veto override will then head to the House, where the same voting process will ensue.\\n\\nIf the veto override is successful in the House and the Senate, the bill will become law because two-thirds of both chambers have agreed to pass the bill despite the president's objection.

       "PITTSBURGH -- Less than a day after protests over the police killing of an African-American man turned violent in North Carolina, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump placed some of the blame for the turmoil on the impact of drugs.\\n\\n\"If you're not aware, drugs are a very, very big factor in what you're watching on television at night,\" said Trump in a speech to the Shale Insight 2016 Conference in Pittsburgh today.\\n\\nOn Wednesday night, Charlotte experienced its second night of protests after the death of Keith Lamont Scott on Tuesday afternoon. Officers in riot gear confronted demonstrators in a downtown commercial area and employed tear gas to control crowds. One person is in critical condition after suffering an apparent gunshot wound.\\n\\nThe Republican nominee condemned the violence, calling for unity.\\n\\n\"Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world's leader. How can we lead when we can't even control our own cities? We honor and recognize the right of all Americans to peacefully assemble, protest and demonstrate, but there is no right to engage in violent disruption or to threaten the public safety and peace of others.\"\\n\\nHe continued to praise law enforcement officers, citing the challenges they face and calling for better training.\\n\\n\"It's tough being a police officer,\" Trump said. \"Police are entrusted with immense responsibility, and we must do everything we can to ensure that they are properly trained, that they respect all members of the public and that any wrongdoing is always — and it will be by them — vigorously addressed.\"\\n\\nBut aside from that one reference, amid his heavy-handed praise for law enforcement and condemnation of protesters, Trump never acknowledged any pattern of violence against African-Americans at the hands of police, which is precisely why so many protesters say they have taken to the streets. They cite the shooting deaths of dozens of other black Americans by police as cause to protest a system they say is dangerous and discriminatory and fails to prosecute far too many officers who kill African-Americans, in many instances unarmed.\\n\\nTrump in recent days has appealed to black Americans, asking them what they have to lose by voting for him, even as he paints an exceptionally grim portrait of black poverty and crime.\\n\\nDuring a rally earlier this week in North Carolina, Trump said, \"We're going to rebuild our inner cities because our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape they've ever been in before. Ever, ever, ever,\"\\n\\nMany African-Americans have bristled at that broad assertion. While many inner cities are plagued by crime and poverty, according to census data from 2015, 52.9 percent of black Americans age 25 or older hold some sort of college degree. A Pew report released in December shows that black adults experienced the largest income increase from 1971 to 2015 and were the only racial group to see a decrease in the percentage of low-income earners. And according to the Census Bureau, almost 73 percent of black Americans do not live in poverty.\\n\\nTrump, in an effort to reach out to the black community, visited Cleveland earlier this week, appearing at a black church. And during a town hall on the Fox News Channel Wednesday night, he was asked about the threat of violence.\\n\\n\"I would do stop and frisk. I think you have to,\" said Trump. \"We did it in New York. It worked incredibly well. And you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically.\"\\n\\nBut this morning in an interview on \"Fox & Friends\" he stepped back from the statement, claiming he was referring to a strategy only for Chicago.\\n\\nIn Pittsburgh, Trump delineated a difference between what he called the \"violent disruptor\" and the rest of the black community. He said it was the country\"s job \"to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace, to walk their children to school and to get their children great

       "Pennsylvania Republicans are trying to jam a bill through the statehouse that would go into effect immediately to allow voter intimidation across the state on Election Day in support of Donald Trump.\\n\\nFirst proposed in June, House Bill 29 would give outsiders the ability to watch the polls in districts in which they do not reside and would give them the power to challenge voters, which would disrupt the voting process and cause delays that could prevent people from exercising their right to vote.\\n\\nIn other words, it would legalize voter intimidation.\\n\\nAs Brennan Center for Justice counsel Adam Gitlin told ProPublica earlier this month, poll watchers, especially those who decide they are going to challenge voters based on their race or religion, could throw a damaging wrench in the democratic process.\\n\\n“There’s actually a risk that, in a more disorganized way, people are going to be showing up to the polls, they won’t know the law, and they’ll be engaging in discriminatory challenges,” Gitlin said. “That can create the potential for a lot of disruption, longer lines because each voter takes longer to vote, and potentially discouraging and intimidating voters from coming to the polls.”\\n\\nAs we all know, conservatives who support Trump are racists who think their brand of Christianity should be the law of the land, so it is likely they will challenge every black and Latino voter they see as well as any voter they think is a Muslim.\\n\\nAnd that’s exactly what Republican nominee Donald Trump wants.\\n\\n“We’re going to watch Pennsylvania,” Trump declared during a rally in the state last month. “Go down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people don’t come in and vote five times. If you do that, we’re not going to lose. The only way we can lose, in my opinion – I really mean this, Pennsylvania – is if cheating goes on.”\\n\\nTrump even has a place on his website where his supporters can sign up to be poll watchers to “Stop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election!”\\n\\nIn response to Trump’s claim that the election will be rigged against him, Pennsylvania Republicans have tacked an amendment on the bill that would make it go into effect immediately if it is passed and signed by the governor. Originally, it was only going to go into effect 60 days after passage.\\n\\nWith the polls showing a close race heading into the first debate, Pennsylvania is even more important now. But voter intimidation could tip the scales significantly in Trump’s favor and effect races down the ticket. In short, Trump and the Republicans are trying to steal the election by making a form of cheating completely legal. And if it works in Pennsylvania you can bet that Republicans will make sure such tactics are legalized everywhere else.

       "Presidential debate moderator Lester Holt pulled two Candy Crowleys, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said Tuesday, accusing of the “NBC Nightly News” anchor of mirroring Crowley’s infamous Mitt Romney fact-check twice on Monday night.\\n\\nIn an interview with “Fox and Friends,” Giuliani said he watched the debate two times — once live, “and then I went home and I watched Lester Holt do Candy Crowley at least twice.”\\n\\nDonald Trump, who had suggested a debate without a moderator ahead of Monday’s faceoff, warned Holt last week not to be like Crowley, who interrupted Romney in 2012 after the then-Republican nominee said it took President Barack Obama 14 days to call the attack in Benghazi, Libya, an “act of terror.” (PolitiFact rated Romney’s criticism “half true,” noting that Obama did say “act of terror” right after the attacks but that the administration did not speak “consistently in the days that followed.\")\\n\\nGiuliani took issue with Holt “ignorantly” attempting to fact-check Trump on the constitutionality of stop-and-frisk and the real estate mogul's false assertion that he never supported the Iraq War.\\n\\nA federal judge in New York ruled the application of the practice unconstitutional, not the policy itself, as Holt suggested, Giuliani argued.\\n\\n“The thing that’s wrong is Lester Holt said straight out: Stop-and-frisk is unconstitutional. Lester Holt is not a lawyer,” Giuliani said. “He’s wrong. It was decided in 1959 by Earl Warren. It is still the law of the land.”\\n\\nThe former mayor maintained that “every cop does stop-and-frisk in every part of America” but gave Hillary Clinton a pass for siding with Holt “because she failed the bar exam.”\\n\\n“But I’m not gonna allow him to play lawyer and contradict our candidate,” he continued. “And I’d like to know: When did a moderator become a fact-checker? And if you’re gonna be a fact-checker, you better darn be right.”\\n\\n“I’m a lawyer. I’m not a moderator who misrepresents on television,” Giuliani said, after co-Steve Doocy noted that Giuliani was fact-checking Holt. “I’m a lawyer. Am I angry about it? I thought after Candy Crowley we saw the last of it. What Holt did last night — if journalism has ethics, if it has ethics, he violated the rules of ethics. Now if you’re gonna interrupt and you’re gonna correct me in front of 100 million people, you better be right. He is dead wrong.”\\n\\nGiuliani continued this verbal broadside, slamming Holt for being “completely unprofessional” and “totally unethical” and suggesting that “he should have had enough energy to check the sources” regarding whether Trump supported the Iraq War.\\n\\n“I saw the tape, and he opposed the Iraq War before the Iraq War,” Giuliani said, despite numerous fact-checks that note Trump voiced support for the war during a 2002 interview with Howard Stern.\\n\\n“A hundred million last night were misled by Lester Holt and so-called lawyer Hillary Clinton,” Giuliani said.

       "Republican nominee Donald Trump’s Ohio chairwoman recently took it upon herself to prove to the world just how delusional the right-wing in America really is when Kathy Miller told reporters that racism in America didn’t exist until President Obama. “I don’t think there was any racism until Obama got elected. We never had problems like this … Now, with the people with the guns, and shooting up neighborhoods, and not being responsible citizens, that’s a big change, and I think that’s the philosophy that Obama has perpetuated on America. Growing up as a kid, there was no racism, believe me. We were just all kids going to school.”\\n\\nThis perfectly illustrates how the right-wing digs their mental bogs of ignorance – blame Obama for literally everything; absolve self/race/identity group of all responsibility, then construct pleasant fantasy.\\n\\nSupporting her candidate’s constant efforts to sabotage what little support he has within the African-American community, she then went on to say that black Americans are responsible for the decades of their socioeconomic disenfranchisement by saying that “if you’re black and you haven’t been successful in the last 50 years, it’s your own fault. You’ve had every opportunity, it was given to you. You’ve had the same schools everybody else went to. You had benefits to go to college that white kids didn’t have. You had all the advantages and didn’t take advantage of it. It’s not our fault, certainly.”\\n\\nTo put a big white cherry on this perverse cake of racism, she then felt the need to add that “the Black Lives Matter movement is a stupid waste of time” and that low voter turnout is probably related to how black Americans “were raised.”\\n\\nIn one fell swoop, this woman has erased four hundred years of slavery, segregation and the Jim Crow era, the widespread lynchings of black Americans by radical Christian terrorist organizations like the Ku Klux Klan, the ghettoization of the inner cities, mass incarceration and the War On Drugs, and the wholesale slaughter of black Americans by law enforcement from the record. Instead, she is blaming the only black president our nation has ever had, when in reality it was his election that brought all the racism to the surface.\\n\\nShe is echoing sentiments shared by a large portion of the American population which has been either brainwashed by media narratives or too ignorant know any better, but it shows just how large a divide we face in try to engage with people so entirely divorced from reality. When the daft old woman was informed that this might sound offensive to some people, she replied “I don’t care, it’s the truth.”\\n\\nThe Trump campaign in a nutshell, ladies and gentlemen.

       "The Essential Research survey also revealed 48 per cent of voters would welcome a national debate on the issue, and showed that two thirds of Australians agree that populist senator Pauline Hanson talks about topics other politicians are afraid to bring up.\\n\\nThe top reasons for wanting a ban were fears over terrorism, and a belief that Muslim migrants do not integrate nor share Australian values. The poll was first conducted in early August and then repeated to ensure the results were not outliers.\\n\\nWriting in The Guardian about the results, Essential Research pollster Peter Lewis says his polling company decided to ask whether people opposed a ban following Ms. Hanson’s maiden speech in the Senate. In it, the populist One Nation party politician proposed Australia end Muslim migration and stop building mosques and Islamic schools.\\n\\nMr. Lewis expresses horror at the number of people sceptical of mass Muslim migration and that large numbers of Labour and Green voters also back a ban.\\n\\nSixty per cent of respondents who support the right-wing Coalition favour an end to Muslim migration along with 40 per cent of Labour voters and 34 per cent of Green voters.\\n\\n“Floored” by the results, the pollster laments that the “basket of deplorables”, who he previously thought were just a “marginalised rump, out of step with the views of modern, mainstream, cosmopolitan Australia”, is too big to ignore.\\n\\nHe writes: “This not a ‘basket of deplorables’ who sit outside the confines of polite society, that is 49% of the men and women who make up our nation.\\n\\n“Yes, they are more likely to vote Coalition or ‘other’ but 40% of Labor voters and one third of Greens agree too. Look around you right now, there are people in your workplace, in your street, on your train, who agree with Hanson.”\\n\\nMr Lewis asserts that voters’ fears over migration are due to increasing feelings of job insecurity among Australians.\\n\\nHe points to this week’s Essential Research report, which revealed a quarter of voters think their jobs will be less secure in the next two years, and that just one third expect to be working with the same employer in five years time.\\n\\nWith a question asking what constitutes the biggest threat to job security in Australia, the top response was “free trade deals that allow foreign workers into the Australian labour market”. A third of respondents opted for this as their answer.\\n\\nMr. Lewis asserts: “While the political insiders see rising insecurity as the natural consequence of technology and our economic affluence, the majority of Australians see it as the outcome of conscious decisions made by their leaders.\\n\\n“Someone feeling insecure does not cheer for free trade deals or see the spread of labour hire and contracting out as the way to reduce costs and make businesses more productive. They endure these decisions and then when they are personally affected, they resent them.”\\n\\nOn the topic of how political elites can deal with Australians who have views he says are informed by “underlying ignorance and mindless stereotypes”, Mr. Lewis claims:\\n\\n“So here’s the challenge to everyone concerned or affronted by these findings. How do you tell half the population that they are wrong?”\\n\\nThe best course of action to challenge Ms. Hanson and her supporters, he concludes, is to talk about “unfashionable ideas [such] as income distribution, workplace bargaining rights, industry development and corporate responsibility.”

       "The FBI investigation of the Hillary Clinton e-mail scandal, where they acknowledged criminal activity yet refused to charge her anyway, has ignited a firestorm of criticism… and it looks like FBI Director James Comey might be the first casualty when heads start to roll. Comey gave immunity to all of Hillary’s top aides, including Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, even though Mills had refused to cooperate with the FBI throughout the investigation and allegedly refused to give investigators her computer for examination. Now, the House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28th that will decide Comey’s fate. Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has loudly called for Comey to resign and when that did not happen, demanded that he lose his job. “This now gets to the point of a serious question as to the director’s fitness for office,” DiGenova said. He believes that the FBI should have had a grand jury convened and a subpoena issued for Mills’ computer. “The contours of this investigation are so embarrassing to the FBI because it is now clear that they immunized people who had criminal exposure and did not conduct a proper investigation before they gave immunity,” he said. “This was not a real investigation. This was a ‘protected investigation’ designed to look like an investigation.” DiGenova demanded that Congress hold hearings to look into the investigation and evidently, they listened. This week, Comey will have to answer for his behavior. Will Congress hold Comey responsible for this joke of an investigation? He isn’t just having to face a hearing - he’s been issued a subpoena from Congress, too. Congress has repeatedly requested that Comey provide certain documents on Clinton’s email scandal and he has repeatedly failed to provide them. In a further attempt to get Comey to comply, Lamar Smith of Texas has slapped Comey with a subpoena compelling him to cough up the documents. How loyal is Comey to Hillary, really? Is he really willing to lose his career or even go to prison to cover for her? And if the answer to that question is “yes,” then the new question becomes… why?

       "The New York Times has joined a number of other major print media publications in denouncing Donald Trump as a liar. Writers at Quartz have noted that “in at least five articles in the New York Times on Sept. 17, including the lead story in the print edition, the words “lie,” “false,” “falsely claimed” and “untrue” appeared in headlines, lead paragraphs, and top sections of the paper’s Trump coverage.\\n\\nExecutive editor Dean Baquet” said that “I think our investigative work—see [the Sept. 17] story on Trump’s tax breaks—has always been hard hitting. But we have decided to be more direct in calling things out when a candidate actually lies…The birther issue represents, well, outright lying. And he lied over a long period. It is a real word and we will use it when warranted.”\\n\\nHopefully this dramatic shift in tone will be a cue to the rest of the mainstream media to abandon their insistence on treating Trump’s statements with more legitimacy than they deserve out of a desire to remain impartial. The right-wing has been exploiting that impartiality for far too long. The Republican primary debates were filled with outright falsehoods and imaginary statistics that largely went unchallenged; and Trump’s entire campaign is based on statements which are simply untrue.\\n\\nBut it appears that Trump’s attempt to gaslight the nation and convince us that it was actually Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton that created the “birther” myth (which is decidedly false) was the last straw for the highly respected editors at the New York Times.

       "The Republican candidate's campaign launched a nationwide filter on the popular social network Monday.\\n\\nWhile some candidates including Hillary Clinton have paid for local Snapchat filters during regional events in the past, this is the first sponsored political filter available nationwide.\\n\\nSnapchat users now have the option to take selfies and photos with a picture frame design that says \"Debate Day: Donald J. Trump vs. Crooked Hillary\" before sharing with friends.\\n\\nThe filter also features fireworks on the sides and a banner at the bottom with his campaign slogan, \"Make America Great Again.\"\\n\\nAnyone can create a filter on Snapchat using the app's Geofilters feature, but its availability is typically limited to proximity to an event, location or community. It's unclear how much Trump's campaign paid for the filter to show up for users nationwide.\\n\\nA spokesperson for the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nSponsored filters have long been a way for Snapchat -- now rebranded as Snap Inc. -- to bring in ad dollars, in addition to showing sponsored videos within the app.\\n\\nTrump and Clinton have used other social media networks, including Twitter (TWTR) and Facebook (FB), to target younger audiences. But Snapchat is notoriously popular with teens and millennials -- a core group of voters both candidates hope to win over.\\n\\n\"Rather than actually try and persuade people, the Trump campaign is throwing money into a fire pit,\" the Clinton campaign said in a statement. \"[This features] a joke that, given Trump's deep unpopularity with young voters, will be used mainly at their own expense.\"\\n\\nLooks like @BernieSanders campaign bought sponsored @Snapchat geotag filter at @HillaryClinton event pic.twitter.com/Yk6ZEMLUH1\\n\\n— Noah Gray (@NoahGrayCNN) January 25, 2016\\nRecent polls suggest Clinton has failed to gain the kind of enthusiasm that drove younger voters to the polls four and eight years ago.\\n\\nBetween the two major party candidates, Clinton has used Snapchat more so far. Earlier this year, Clinton's camp launched a filter which targeted those attending a Trump rally in California. Clinton also released one during the Republican National Convention, which featured a quote from Trump about how Clinton would make a great president.\\n\\nDuring the primaries, presidential hopefuls like Bernie Sanders also used a filter during a Clinton rally.

And I’ll give you a perfect example.\\n\\nWhen the Dallas Mavericks were building a new practice facility which was just opening I had the opportunity to go to Dallas and and play different cities against each other to get different rebates and everything. I didn’t do it. A couple years ago we had some issues in Dallas, I just wrote a check to the general treasury.\\n\\nThis year we had, after the shootings in Orlando, I had concerns about the LGBT community in Dallas. I just wrote a million dollar check to the city of Dallas to support a bunch of different programs. I’m, I’m the luckiest guy in the world. There’s nobody who’s been as blessed as me and my family, so far, knock on wood, is healthy, and at some point you have to realize you have to give back. And you have to realize that this is a country that’s been great to us. And you can’t just take, take, take, take, take, take.\\n\\nThe contrast between Cuban and Trump could not be more stark. Cuban believes in paying his fair share to society to help those who are less fortunate than him, while admitting he owes his success to society. Trump is content and even proud that he bleeds society for as much money as possible, while offering to pay back nothing. Did Trump say he was interested in paying higher taxes? No. Did Trump say he would like to reform the tax code so that he would be forced to pay higher taxes? No.\\n\\nTrump has no interest in paying his taxes to help fund schools so that children will grow to be more intelligent, because if they did they would certainly not support him. Trump has no interest in paying taxes to help pay for the roads which are used to deliver the cheaply made Chinese goods to which his name is affixed. In Trump’s world there is a two-tiered system. One for him, and one for everyone else.

       "The “he said/she said” method of reporting—in which journalists observe the profession’s convention and get at least two sides of every story—has been taking it on the chin ever since New York University journalism professor Jay Rosen placed it in his gunsights in 2009 and started ack-acking it with regularity.\\n\\nBut the \"he said/she said\" debate didn’t move from the margins to the mainstream until last week when the New York Times abandoned mechanical balance and published a Page One, above-the-fold piece by Michael Barbaro, shredding Donald Trump as a pitiful serial liar and obfuscator for his latest “birther” declaration. The Times piece elated critics of the \"he said/she\" said construct. In an Atlantic piece titled “The Death of ‘He Said, She Said’ Journalism,” Peter Beinart pronounced Barbaro’s work a journalistic sea change. Trump had broken all the rules of political conduct, Beinart stated, and the Times had rightly ditched a few of its own. Abandoning the usual journalistic etiquette, which calls for mendacious politicians to be described as committing a falsehood when what they’re actually doing is lying, the Times piece dealt with Trump with “astonishing bluntness,” Beinart wrote, repeatedly calling Trump’s birther nonsense a “lie.” Trump was given no opportunity in the piece to deny the charges, which sits just fine with the \"he said/she said\" critics.\\n\\nWhile I consider Trump to be a first-rate liar and don’t mind saying so, I’m not convinced that jettisoning the \"he said/she said\" blueprint is such a good idea. Every politician lies. If we were to police all politicians in the news pages the way Barbaro did Trump, it would be entertaining. But political journalism as we know it could expire as profiles and news stories collapsed into spreadsheets grading the truth value of political utterances. Isn’t that what the fact-checker columns are for?\\n\\nIn his widely applauded critiques of \"he said/she said\" journalism, Rosen holds that by reflexively seeking the “other side” of every public dispute and shying away from expressing the truth, the media creates a bogus symmetry between the “he said” voices in a story and the prevaricators serving up the “she said” dissent. “Do users really want to be left helpless in sorting out who’s faking it more?” Rosen asked, proposing that journalists put a higher premium on seeking truth and avoiding distortion. The \"he said/she said\" structure constitutes “one of the lowest forms of journalism in existence,” he would later remark.\\n\\nDonald Trump, the thinking goes, has gamed the \"he said/she said\" convention to contaminate the political debate with his lies, obfuscations and double-talk whenever the press seeks comment on an issue, a clarification of something he’s said, or a response to a point raised by his opponent, Hillary Clinton. This is true. In speeches and interviews, he’s expressed a broadband stream of lies, such as denying that he’s used terms like “fat pig” to describe women, insisting that he never called George W. Bush a liar, claiming that he opposed the Iraq War, making fallacious boasts about his acts of philanthropy, asserting that the NFL had contacted him about the debate schedule, and more, much more. But they are lies, all lies. And every time the media quotes one of Trump’s “she said” lies without a correcting fact-check, it undermines the truth of the “he said” side of the debate. At least, so the thinking goes.\\n\\nBut has journalists' practice of giving Trump the right of reply, allowing him to pearl his lies with another coating of deceit really been such a disaster? One result of the straight, \"he said/she said\" coverage of the Trump style has been his record lows in the Washington Post/ABC News favorability poll. Thanks to this coverage, many voters are able to see through Trump’s “post-truth” style of politics and don’t need the news pages directly calling him a lying liar who lies every time he speaks. Among his supporters, many don’t care that he mangles the facts and others take secret glee in the trickster’s campaign he’s waging for the presidency: He’s serving baloney and his supporters can’t get enough of it.\\n\\nAs bracing and as full of truth-telling as the Barbaro piece was, I hope it doesn’t embolden other news pages to abandon convention. The formula, when properly executed, forces reporters to perform due diligence in their articles. The form is even more useful for skeptical “show me” readers, who want those extra bits of evidence to help them make up their mind about a candidate or an issue. This, I realize, can be especially challenging with Trump because the Mouth of Manhattan has made a career of taking both sides on nearly everything. He is the hermaphrodite of opinion makers—both \"he said and she said\"—and, like any good circus freak, that makes him too exceptional to build rules from.\\n\\nOne reason I admire \"he said/she said\" journalism is that I often find myself sympathizing with the \"she-said\" side of the equation, and its presence assures me that the reporter is conducting something approximating an open inquiry. Whenever the \"she-said\" component of a story goes missing, leaving only the dominant position expressed, I get the feeling I’m being fed bunk. Even the Holy Bible gives Satan a forum for his dastardly views. So why not news stories?\\n\\nI don’t believe a story must balance out like a chemistry equation until both sides (or multiple sides) hover in the ether in perfect equilibrium. But intellectual history informs us that the dominant positions in any field—ruling paradigms, if you don’t mind the language—have a tendency to erode over time when exposed to minority critiques. In order for thought to progress, the minority report—however seemingly misguided—must be heard.\\n\\nThe history of science is pockmarked with paradigms that were blown away by she-saiders. Early in the last century, for example, the scientific and cultural elites espoused the misguided philosophy of eugenics, which held that feeblemindedness was directly inheritable and that forced sterilization, institutionalization or lobotomization for these lessers was right and just. To oppose eugenics was to place yourself outside the established consensus, to define yourself as a crackpot, to be reduced to a \"she-said\" if you were lucky enough to get quoted in a news story. Today, we think of the eugenicists as troglodytes.\\n\\nOr consider the story of Alfred Wegener. He 1912, he proposed his plate tectonic theory much to the derision of the scientific establishment who laughed at the idea of continental drift. Not until the 1960s did his ideas gain proper respect, and his critics take his place as geology’s crackpots. Or take the example of Australian doctor Barry Marshall, who conjectured in the early 1980s that bacteria and not stress was the cause of ulcers, a condition that afflicted up to 10 percent of all adults. Even after Marshall induced an ulcer in his own stomach by drinking a potion containing Helicobacter pylori he was still derided and marginalized by the establishment. “You think, ‘It’s science; it’s got to be accepted,’” Marshall told Discover magazine. “But it’s not an absolute given.” By the mid-1990s, the idea finally took root, undermining the business model of thousands of gastroenterologists who treated and retreated the affliction with ineffective drugs and surgery. In 2005, Marshall and a colleague were awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine for their Helicobacter pylori work. Science abounds with equally dramatic stories.\\n\\nObviously, the critiques of every she-saider don’t automatically end in the triumphs Wegener and Marshall enjoyed. But when you catalog the ruling paradigms in science and technology that have been toppled in recent years, the toppler was almost always marginalized in the early going. Fracking has all but destroyed the peak oil hypothesis. The “one-size, fits all” advice on mammograms has been abandoned. Our views on saturated fat, once almost holy writ, have been chucked. Until 1973, the American Psychiatric Association classified homosexuality as a mental disorder. (All is not progress: Some now argue that “homophobia” is an indicator of a disorder.) Marijuana makes you mad. (Today, the equally suspicious paradigm is that marijuana is good for whatever ails you.) Coffee, once thought to be bad for you, turns out to be good for you, at least for now. Moving over to the policy realm, the once dominant “super-predator” thesis was once supported across partisan lines. It is now discredited. Remember how Japan’s economy was supposed to overtake the United States’? Remember how Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said the U.S. economic system was stable? Experts predicted wild inflation after quantitative easing. Others posited that housing prices would never decline nationwide. And so on.\\n\\nThe dissents of the she-saiders are generally beneficial. Whether right or wrong, the dissenters have a way of increasing everybody’s knowledge. If they are wrong, as Michael Shermer has written, their untruths force the dominant paradigm to self-examine, and if warranted, use new evidence to improve its position. If the she-saiders are right, they advance human thought. That’s how science works, and I believe journalism should work that way, too. Vaccine pioneer Jonas Salk summarized the predictable moves of the knee-jerk paradigm-defenders with this progression. “First,” Salk writes, they say “that it can’t be true.” Second phase: “Well, if it’s true, it’s not very important.” Third phase: “Well, we’ve known it all along.”\\n\\nBefore anybody puts words in my mouth, this is not my long-winded way of saying I don’t subscribe to the global warming hypothesis. I do—but at the same time, I keep my options open. The protectors of the ruling paradigm have an intellectual responsibility to mount disciplined defense against all comers. Even against crackpots.\\n\\nThe last and best reason for supporting “he said/she said” journalism: So many readers and viewers have self-segregated by limiting their news consumption to outlets that reflect their personal views. These days, many readers get only the \"he said\" side of the story or just the \"she said\" side, remaining deliberately oblivious to the vibrant debate that might actually be going on. While I value partisan media, I also value nonpartisan news operations—like POLITICO—that make ideas duel in their news pages. NPR News Director Michael Oreskes puts this practical spin on why his organization shies away from calling liars liars: “[I]f you present the facts calmly and without a tone of editorializing, you substantially increase the chance that people will hear you out and weigh the facts. That is why the tone of journalism matters so much. We need potential listeners and readers to believe we are presenting the facts honestly, and not to confirm our opinions.”\\n\\nIf you’re not getting a steady diet of \"she said\" quotations in your news consumption, you’re at risk of starving to death. \"He said/she said\" keeps journalists honest, even if, on occasion, it looks like it’s only accruing to the benefit of a beast like Donald Trump.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         46.750000\n",
       "There has been a lot of speculation and anger surrounding the shooting of a black man by Charlotte police. Such anger, in fact, has bred more riots in North Carolina, which led to looting, theft of private property and the shutdown of I-85. But all we’re being told is the side of things where the man was an innocent little cupcake on his way to volunteer at a soup kitchen before he read stories to blind, homeless children and donated all of his paycheck to the local animal shelter. What is the story coming from the police officers involved in the shooting? Does anyone care? Does it even matter what the cops say happened? The riots have already started and the hatred is already coursing through the veins of people who are just looking for a reason to take to the streets, so will this change anything? To those of us who actually uses our brains in these situations, it could make all the difference. The Blaze posted the statement of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief on the incident. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said during a news conference Wednesday morning that officers were searching for a suspect Tuesday when they saw 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott exit a vehicle with a handgun. He says the officers told him to drop the gun and that he got out of the vehicle a second time still carrying the gun. He says the man was shot because he posed a threat. “It’s time to change the narrative, because I can tell you from the facts that the story’s a little bit different as to how it’s been portrayed so far, especially through social media,” he said. As an officer, you’re hearing about your brothers and sisters in blue being shot by thugs who have a chip on their shoulder. You hear this and then you see a man get out of his vehicle with a firearm. You tell him to put the gun down, and he refuses. Are you supposed to wait until he shoots first? If a man breaks into your house, are you supposed to wait until he actually harms you before you protect yourself? How does that even make sense? Oh that’s right, it doesn’t. Of course, that doesn’t stop progressives from declaring that they know exactly how things should be happening. You know, with their degrees in women’s studies and art history, they’re clearly the most qualified people to be criticizing the actions of our law enforcement.

       "There’s a lot that could be discussed about last night’s debate, like the unfair debate moderator asking questions to help Hillary, but that’s not the main concern right now.\\n\\nThere is one thing that has baffled many…. Hillary didn’t appear to be her usually stupid coughing self! She was so ready with answers and detailed facts. Almost just as bizarre was that not once did she sputter or reach for a glass of water. This is so odd that it has everyone and their grandma talking!\\n\\nThe latest question swirling around on social media are the pictures that appeared to show Hillary with some kind of flesh-colored device embedded inside her ear…is that an earpiece she is wearing? Or just something fashionable for old ladies?\\n\\nTwitter may have figured out the answer…do you see it?\\n\\nIt certainly wouldn’t be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Could it be a trick of light and shadows? A puffy zipper, perhaps? Or was Hillary actually hiding a “Cough prevention machine” in her hideous feminist pantsuit?\\n\\nHillary Clinton’s campaign is fervently denying that she was wearing an earpiece.\\n\\nFox News reported that “Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said what is seen in the photo is merely a reflection of the TV lights or a flash.”\\n\\nWhile we aren’t sure what was going on inside Hillary’s little head last night, we do have a very interesting email posted by Woods from Clinton and Huma Abedin that the WikiLeaks archive released, “Did u take your earpiece or do I need to get it?”\\n\\nWoods had a hidden sense of humor that escaped him on twitter…“She can’t even #lie without help from a gaggle of other #liars through an earpiece.”\\n\\nThen Woods added:\\n\\n“She literally can’t help herself. She’s the kind of sociopath who will lie even if the truth were more beneficial.”\\n\\nOf course, we don’t have actual proof of the earpiece, it could have just been a hearing aid. Hmmm no one has talked about Hillary wearing an earpiece in the past when she fumbled through her speeches.\\n\\nSome claim it’s merely a reflection of studio lights. We’ll let you be the judge.

      "Because it would not be worthwhile to bring a case for $ 30.22 , the arbitration clause would , as a practical matter , deny the Concepcions any relief and , more important , eliminate a class action that might punish AT&T for its pattern of fraudulent behavior .\n",
      "Indeed , Lind argues that high profits and high wages reinforce each other because workers then have the wherewithal to buy the products they are making .\n",
      "In fairness , it should be noted that he devotes an entire chapter to New York Times political columnist Maureen Dowd , a liberal who makes much of the outsized rivalries , jealousies , and personalities that dominate American politics .\n",

      "The Federal Housing Finance Regulatory Reform Act of 2008 should have been an easy sell , since it purportedly aimed to assist homeowners , a more popular ( or at least more sentimentalized ) subset of Americans than greedy Wall Street tycoons .\n",
      "Yet for all its submerged class snobbery and anti-intellectualism disguised as cool detachment , the ultimate failure of the Washington media lies less with the personal failings of its elite members than its structural inadequacy .\n",
      "Rumsfeld then went on to discuss how China 's lack of transparency with respect to its defense expenditures and activities raises doubts in the region about China 's intentions .\n",
      "You never hear from the co-conspirators of the left-wing media how many innocent victims are dead , raped , and mutilated as a direct result of these left-wing policies and insane anti-gun laws .\n",
      "\n",
      "Neutral examples (out of 600 sentences): \n",
      "In this country , the beneficiaries of Apple 's success are , first , the designers , who have done wonders working with Steve Jobs to produce products that are beautiful and effective .\n",
      "The problem with this argument is that China reports about 68 percent of the world 's aquaculture production , and the FAO , which has been burned by inflated Chinese statistics before , expresses doubt about its stated production and growth rates . ''\n",
      "The soil exhaustion caused by the plantation system , as well as the relatively low productivity of forced labor , compelled planters to seek new lands to exploit .\n",
      "The same complexity that leads to such malfunctions also creates vulnerabilities that human agents can use to make computer systems operate in unintended ways .\n",
      "Threads of new awkwardness stretch out between them , and nature itself winks behind their backs and plays nasty tricks on them , scattering yellow clods of asters and groundsel , blanketing purple clover and pink flax , erecting stalks of huge -- but smelly -- purple arum flowers , sprinkling red buttercups , and hanging baby oranges and lemons on the trees around them .\n",
